            "Summary (English)" : "\"Codex Florus dispersus” contains a virtual reconstruction of a manuscript of letters and sermons by Augustine. It was written by a single hand in a late 7th or early 8th century uncial script. The manuscript evidently originated in France, perhaps in Luxeuil or in Lyon. Originally the manuscript contained at least 30 quinions (at least 300 leaves), of which 117 leaves remain today. One part with 63 leaves from the original quires 4-11 is currently held in Paris (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bnf/lat11641\">BnF, lat. 11641</a>); after leaf 26 there could be inserted a single leaf which currently is held in St. Petersburg (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/nlr/lat-F-I-1\">NLR, Lat.F.papyr. I.1</a>). Another part with 53 leaves from the original quires 24-30 is being held in Geneva (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bge/lat0016\">Bibliothèque de Genève, lat. 16</a>). The outer leaf of each quire (quinio) is parchment, while the remaining leaves are papyrus. During the 9th century the volume was part of the library of Florus of Lyon, who added numerous marginalia to the manuscript in his own hand. \"sine loco\", codices restituti, Cod. 1 contains a virtual reconstruction of the surviving pieces in their original order.",

At the front of the volume there used to be a full-page illustration consisting of an artistic portrayal of Job with his three friends (upper half) and a portrayal of Gregory the Great and a writing monk (lower half), who according to custom represents Peter the Deacon (Petrus Diaconus). This leaf with a verse of dedication by Frowin on the back, the actual recto side, was carefully described by P. Karl Stadler in his hand-written catalog of 1787; this helped to identify the <i>membrum disiectum</i>, which is now held by the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cma/1955-74\">The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1955.74</a> (Purchase from the J.H.

It was written by private initiative between 1510 and 1535 and took as its model primarily the Official Bernese Chronicle - <i>Amtliche Berner Chronik</i> - by Diebold Schilling and the Chronicle - <i>Kronica</i> - by Petermann Etterlin. This volume, the third and last of the Chronicle, presents the events of the Burgundian Wars and the Swabian War; it ends with the Italian military campaigns, among others the Battle of Marignano on September 13th and 14th 1515, in which presumably the author himself took part. The volume is illustrated with 196 uncolored pen sketches by an anonymous artist. Today the three volumes are held in different libraries: the first volume is in the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/lsb/Ms0062\">Leopold-Sophien-Bibliothek in Überlingen</a>, the second in the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/stab/0002\">City Archives in Bremgarten</a>, and the third in the Cantonal Library of Aargau.",

The prayer book receives its name from Elisabeth Blumin, deceased 23 May 1550, who is mentioned at the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/A-XI-0064/105v\">end</a>, and who may have been the first owner of this manuscript.",

The commentaries were copied around the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th century, a project that did not provide for miniatures on the frontispiece. These were added a short time later, together with a prologue. The codex still retains the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/AN-I-0008/bindingA\">binding</a> that was created in Constantinople between 1435 and 1437 during a restoration for its new owner, the Dominican John of Ragusa, who brought the codex to Basel in 1437.",

A German Anglo-Saxon manuscript from the second half of the 8th century containing the second book of Isidore’s <i>Synonyma</i> was supplemented in the first third of the 9th century, probably in Fulda, with the first book of the same work by Isidore. Very early already, this was bound together with another item containing <i>Admonitio ad filium spiritualem</i> by Pseudo-Basilius as well as various excerpts, which probably were also written in Fulda around 800.",

The various parts and texts are written in Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian minuscule and originated in Fulda and its surroundings, up to Mainz. The leather <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/F-III-0015e/bindingA\">binding</a>, presumably still Carolingian, was much changed at a later time, especially due to the removal of the covers.

Today it bears the shelf mark <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/ubb/N-I-0001-3c\">N I 1: 3c</a>‬‬.",

Sayyid Ǧalāladdīn Mazīd Bahādur is named as the person who commissioned the manuscript; he probably was part of the local upper class.

With this, there came to be travelogues like this one from 1621 by the jurist and rector of the University of Basel, Remigius Faesch (1595-1667).",

The manuscript, consisting of 197 leaves in Bern as well as 24 leaves in Paris (<a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b90664807\" target=\"_blank\">BNF, lat. 7520</a>), is the oldest grammar manuscript from Fleury; it contains an early medieval corpus of Roman grammarians from antiquity and from the early medieval period: Bede, Donatus, Maximus Victorinus, Julianus Toletanus, Servius Honoratus, Asper minor, Sergius, Petrus Pisanus, Isidore, as well as numerous other anonymous treatises and excerpts.",

Lupus received the arithmetic book (<i>Calculus</i>) by Victorius of Aquitaine along with a now widely known model alphabet for Ancient Capitals. Around 1000, texts by Abbo of Fleury on the ‘computus’ (reckoning the date for Easter) were then added at the abbot’s home monastery on the Loire (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0250/12r\">fol. 12</a>–<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0250/28v\">28</a>), along with an abacus table (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0250/1r\">fol. 1r</a>).

Lupus himself wrote the <i>Exempla</i> and the comment on the sometime \"flyleaves\" (f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0366/V2r\">II</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0366/V3v\">III</a>), repeatedly collated the main text, added supplements from the parallel transmission of Iulius Paris (an <i>abbreviator</i> of Valerius Maximus) and also its accompanying text (Gaius Titius Probus: <i>De praenominibus</i>; f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0366/158v\">158va</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0366/159r\">159r</a>).

(He should not be confused with his contemporary Leoniceno Niccolò [1428-1524], a physician, philosopher and professor in Ferrara.) This manuscript has a key role in cultural history, as the texts by Theoprastus and most of the Aristotelian texts it contains served as the basis for the Aldine edition of 1497. Similarly, it served as the basis for the translation of Aristotle's <i>Mechanica</i> published by the manuscript's owner in 1525 in Venice. In the margin of the manuscript one can see the efforts of Nicolaus Thomaeus to devise figures to illustrate the translation.",

Presumably the Bernese merchant Jörg Friburger commissioned the manuscript in 1467 from the scribe Johann Stemhein of Konstanz, who edited and stylistically modernized the text of his model to match the tastes of a late medieval urban public. In addition, he gave directions for illustrations, which were later executed by a painter who created 28 colored pen and ink drawings. The further history of this manuscript,which today consists of 180 leaves, is unknown; it must, however, have reached the Bernese municipal library in the early years of the 19th century, where it is attested at least since 1816.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript assembles about 700 documents from the years 814-1242, which concern the administration of the Chapter and the Cathedral of Lausanne. The compilation of the cartulary began around 1202 and was completed in 1242; 5 files, dated 1250-1294, were added later. The material structure of the manuscript is very complex because of numerous additions to the original core, which corresponds to the <i>Livre censier du Chapitre cathédral de Lausanne</i> of about 1202. The manuscript contains various texts: the Annals of Lausanne, a topographic cartulary, a chronological register, two chronicles, an urbarium, the Chronicle of the Bishops of Lausanne and the Cathedral’s necrology. The author of this valuable collection is Conon d’Estavayer (before 1200-1243/1244), who became Dean of the Cathedral in 1202. From 1216 until 1242, he directly supervised the editing of the manuscript and the organization of the documents.",

It was probably written shortly after the original, and thus it is the oldest Romansh document preserved in the original. The alliance of 1544 is a renewal of the alliance between the Grey League, the League of the Ten Jurisdictions and the League of God's House of 23 September 1524, which is generally considered the founding act of the Free State of the Three Leagues. The dating of the manuscript is uncertain since the date 11 November 1544 refers to the German document, which, however, does not bear the signature of Friedrich von Salis. According to the note of confirmation of 8 February 1605, the manuscript must at least have been written prior to this date.",

After the fall of the monarchy in 1792, the comedy was again performed on several Parisian stages, albeit the concluding songs were modified by Beaumarchais. The final stanza of the stuttering judge Don Gusman Brid’oison, which in 1784 had concluded <i>Tout fini-it par des chansons</i>, was adapted to the difficulties of the period: <i>Pour tromper sa maladie, / Il</i> [the people] <i>chantoit tout l’opera : / Dame ! il n’sait plus qu’ce p’tit air-là : / Ca ira, ça ira</i>... However, after the fall of Robespierre and the Thermidorian Reaction, these words roiled young Muscadins just as the previous ones had caused the Sansculottes to react. Since the performances were disrupted by such turbulent audiences, Beaumarchais entrusted La Rochelle, the actor who performed the role of Brid’Oison, with an alternative ending that could be recited <i>en cas de bruit</i> (in case of noise). This variant, which remained unpublished until recently, was a praise of freedom of speech and of the <i>sang froid de la raison</i> (the cold blood of reason) against the <i>stratagème</i> (wiles) of ideological cabals.",

This <i>mass in D major</i> seeks to express and communicate, in\r\nthe words of the composer himself, a state of mind, a religious <i>Stimmung</i>. It is written for a large orchestra and consists\r\nof five movements (<i>Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei</i>)  The sections of the <i>Gloria</i>, imposed by the meaning of the text, constitute a sonata: <i>allegro</i> in D major, <i>Gratias</i> in B flat and back to the <i>allegro</i>; then the <i>larghetto</i> and as a third movement the <i>allegro</i>, <i>Quoniam</i>, the fugue <i>In gloria Dei Patris</i>, with a cyclical return to the theme of the <i>Gloria</i> in the principal tone. The music comments on the text: royal acclamation, heartfelt gratitude, divine omnipotence; then, in contrast: prayers, shouts and murmurs of the supplicants of this world (<i>miserere nobis</i>).

The first part, written in a single column (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0103/1r\">pp. 1r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0103/272r\">272</a>), contains the <i>Buch der Natur</i> (<i>Prologfassung</i>) by Conrad of Megenberg. This part of the manuscript features marginal corrections and glosses (especially for medically relevant parts of the text), which may be by the original owner of the manuscript (Hayer 1998, p. 162). Especially parts I, III, IV, and V of the <i>Buch der Natur</i> contain marginal notes and interlinear glosses in a 15th century hand which reworks the natural history texts allegorically for preaching. Numerous smaller and larger marginal illustrations. The second part, written in two columns (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0103/274r\">pp. 274ra</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0103/307r\">307rb</a>) contains a medical compendium in six parts (childhood illnesses – illnesses due to the imbalance of the <i>humores</i> – diseases of the eyes – the plague, skin diseases, fever – surgery and wound care – venereal diseases, bone injuries, burns), Latin and German recipes and prescriptions, as well as a German table of contents. On p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0103/284r\">284ra</a> is a drawing of surgical instruments. Formerly privately owned by the antiquarian Hans P.

This heroic epic (<i>chanson de geste</i>) in rhymed decimeter and Alexandrines tells of the campaign of Charlemagne in Italy against the pagan king Agolant and his son Helmont. The Anglo-Norman manuscript held by the Fondation Martin Bodmer was produced in the 13th century and contains interlinear and marginal corrections, added in a second hand at a slightly later date than that in which the text was written. Because the additions were doubtless made with the help of a proofing manuscript, we can thus measure the complex effort that was required for the dissemination of this text.",

In the absence of a title page, the decoration is limited to a series of initials, created by two different artists; one with <i>bianchi girari</i>, the other with interlace on a background of gold, sometimes referred to as “a cappio annodato.“ Each epigram begins with a simple initial in blue. Produced in Northern Italy in the middle of the 15th century, the manuscript was verifiably in France since the 18th century, in the hands of the Jarente de Sénas family; later it was owned by Ambroise Firmin-Didot. During the 19th century, ownership changed several times before the manuscript became part of the collection of Martin Bodmer.",

The text is annotated with marginal and interlinear glosses by various contemporaneous and Italian hands from the 15th century. Four types of notes can be discerned: structuring, lexical and philological, intertextual and commenting, which testify to the vitality of Ovid’s text in the 14th century and up to the beginning of the modern era. The frontispiece is decorated with a letter surrounding a portrait of the author during the composition of his work, as well as a side border bearing an angel with red wings.",

There are some marginal glosses written in violet ink as well as other, newer additions which were probably made during the 16th century. After Herodotus and Thucydides, Polybius is the third-greatest Greek historian. He concentrated on accounts of the Roman conquest, as characterized in the many conflicts that took place in a variety of different locations.",

The manuscript is illustrated with 19 vignettes, most of which are surrounded by an architectural frame containing representations of figures in period clothing.

Divided into three books, the work begins with an outline of the history of the kings of France up to Charlemagne (Book I: f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0015/7v/0/Sequence-1783\">7v</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0015/19r/0/Sequence-1783\">19r</a>), followed by the history of the “merveilleux et terrible“ giant Fierabras (Book II: f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0015/19v/0/Sequence-1783\">19v</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0015/93v/0/Sequence-1783\">93v</a>), and a story about the Spanish War according to <i>Turpin</i> (Book III: f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0015/94r/0/Sequence-1783\">94r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0015/117v\">117v</a>). This copy and the Bibliothèque de Genève’s copy (Ms. fr. 188) are the only two handwritten witnesses of this text, which experienced great success in print from the 15th century onward (1st printed edition by Adam Steinschaber in Geneva in 1478).",

The codex was produced around the middle or in the second half of the 13th century in Central or Eastern France. It is distinguished and made luxurious by no fewer than 82 historiated initials and 66 ornamental initials. Noteworthy is the fact that the biblical text shows signs of careful correction and that the psalms are divided into smaller sections according to a scheme, which rules out that it was commissioned by a monastery, but suggests instead that it was commissioned by a secular priest or a layperson. An erased note of ownership suggests that in 1338 this manuscript belonged to the Celestine Monastery Notre-Dame of Ternes (Limoges), perhaps a gift from its founder Roger le Fort, who was the son of the Lord of Ternes and was Archbishop of Bourges in 1343. Before this Bible became part of the collection of Martin Bodmer, it belonged to the collection of Baron Edmond de Rothschild (1845-1935), hence the name “Rothschild-Bibel.”",

CB 53 was copied in Burgundy and may be fairly accurately dated only a few years after the translation was made; it was decorated with miniatures in the artistic circle of the Master of Marguerite of York (ca. 1470-1475).",

It is also known by the title \"Zaigo chūjō nikki\", or \"Diaries of the Prince Ariwara no Narihira\". The main character in the Tale of Ise is understood as being the historical prince and poet Ariwara no Narihira (9th century), whose <i>waka</i> feature in the tale. Yet due to the existence of narratives that clearly date to later periods, Narihira himself cannot be regarded as the author. The tale is generally concerned with human affection of many kinds, from amorous affairs to parental affection. Whilst many chapters do have a strong aristocratic notion, it is not limited to the world of nobility, but also includes the commoner’s fate, such as Chapter 23 Tsutsuizutsu. The characters often remain unnamed and are only referred to as ‘the girl’, or ‘the man’. Thus, the tale is interpretable as an effort to generally address the topic of human relationship and affection.

Yet due to the existence of narratives that clearly date to later periods, Narihira himself cannot be regarded as the author. The tale is generally concerned with human affection of many kinds, from amorous affairs to parental affection. Whilst many chapters do have a strong aristocratic notion, it is not limited to the world of nobility, but also includes the commoner’s fate, such as Chapter 23 Tsutsuizutsu. The characters often remain unnamed and are only referred to as ‘the girl’, or ‘the man’. Thus, the tale is interpretable as an effort to generally address the topic of human relationship and affection.

The complete version of the sutra encompasses six-hundred chapters. It was introduced to China from India by the monk, scholar and translator Xuanzang, who translated the sutra into Chinese in the 7th century before it was imported into Japan. The sutra is written in black ink on high-quality paper, very likely <i>kōzo-shi</i>, which is made using the fibre of Broussonetia papyrifera or paper mulberry tree, especially treasured and used for important documents during the early periods of Japanese history such as the Nara and Heian periods. There is a circular red seal placed over the top of the first four lines of the text, stating “Yakushi-ji-in” (seal of the temple Yakushi-ji). The sutra was written in Japan within the context of the religious rites of reproducing holy scripture to benefit the karma.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Carolingian reform efforts responded to a desire to regularize religious orders by creating a unified rule for monastic life, the <i>Concordia regularum</i> of Benedict of Aniane. In the resulting course of events, an effort was made during the turn from the 9th to the 10th century to dinstinguish the monastic status from the canonical. In 816 Ludwig the Pious made the results of the Council of Aix public; the first part of the <i>Institutio canonicorum</i> presents the statutes of the church fathers and the previous councils, the second part explains the resolutions of the council. The task of putting this work into writing was long attributed to Amalarius of Metz, a student of Alcuin and advisor of Charlemagne; however, another author must be acknowledged for this work, which totals 118 chapters, some of which are extremely comprehensive: Benedict of Aniane is also supposed to have been a contributor. The manuscript held by the Fondation Martin Bodmer was copied only a few years after the original publication of the text (in the first half of the 9th century) in a very fine Carolingian script, and it belonged to the Benedictine Abbey of St. Jacob in Mainz. A full-page drawing portraying the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0068/154v\">crucifixion</a> was added in the 12th or 13th century at the end of the book.",

The main text is the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> (\"Song of the Lord\"), a part of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>\r\n epic, book 6, which consists of 18 chapters, written here in Devanāgarī\r\n in a Kashmiri-influenced style (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/1v/0/Sequence-2105\">1v</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/165r/0/Sequence-2105\">165r</a>). It is one of the most \r\ncopied texts in the Hindu tradition and survives in a huge number of \r\nmanuscripts. Painted portraits of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna alternate in opening \r\nits 18 chapters. The <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> is preceded by the <i>Prayāgatīrthasnānasaṃkalpa, apadoddhāraṇastotra</i> (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/V2r/0/Sequence-2105\">V2r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/V4v/0/Sequence-2105\">V4v</a>),\"a promise to take bath at Prayāga (Allahabad)\", and followed by the <i>Pañcavaktrahanumatkavaca</i> (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/N1v/0/Sequence-2105\">N1v</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/N7v/0/Sequence-2105\">N7v</a>), a protective mantra of Hanuman, and finally the <i>Stavarāja</i>\r\n (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/N8r/0/Sequence-2105\">N8r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/N8v/0/Sequence-2105\">N8v</a>), a \"king of praises\", serving also as a sort of colophon to \r\nthe whole collection of these miscellaneous texts. These three \r\nsubsidiary texts are all written in common Devanāgarī script. A partly \r\nreadable note dated 29 August 1781 identifies the manuscript as a \r\n“prayer book of a bramin [i.e. brahmin]” given to the unidentified \r\npossessor of the manuscript  “on his departure from India” (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0704/V1r/0/Sequence-2105\">V1r</a>).",

Writing had already developed in 12th century Central America as a mixture of ideograms, pictograms and phonetic symbols, but the original handwritten witnesses thereof were destroyed in the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century. In order to communicate with the indigenous population, Christian missionaries later adopted this writing system, but they invented many symbols since the goal was to communicate a new, Christian content. For instance, three crowned heads represent the Trinity and thus God, while two crowned heads with key and sword represent the apostles Peter and Paul. The manuscript is read from left to right across both pages; different parts are separated by decorative vertical vignettes. The manuscript contains several short prayers (among them <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/1v\">pp. 1v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/2r\">2r</a> <i>Persignum</i>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/2v\">2v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/4r\">4r</a> <i>Ave Maria</i>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/4v\">4v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/8r\">8r</a> <i>Credo</i>) and a long prayer (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/27v\">27v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/35r\">35r</a>) which represents a repetition of the  Christian doctrine.",

Relying heavily on the--often unreliable--etymologies of the words, Isidore collected in his work the whole of ancient knowledge, in order to prevent it from being forgotten. This manuscript was produced about the end of the 13th century, possibly in the area of the University at Paris and is a witness to the enormous success of this extensive encyclopedia. ",

Later know by the title <i>Le Chant de la Courtisane</i>, this prose poem in a humorous tone was not published by Flaubert himself. Nonetheless, it sums up his challenges as a writer: the work shows the author’s fascination with Oriental culture and landscape, which he hopes to to reproduce in a realistic manner. A journal of his voyage, which records his observations and sensations and directly feeds his fictional work. The vocabulary reveals a certain erudition and a concern for accuracy, procedures which herald <i>Salammbô</i>. This manuscript, from the collection of Paul Voute (who had published a facsimile thereof in 1928), was purchased by Martin Bodmer at the Blaizot bookstore.",

Upon his return in 1858, the writer worked on a chapter that would be “the topographical and picturesque description of the aforementioned city, with a portrayal of the people who inhabited it, including the traditional costume, government, religion, finances and commerce, etc.\" (Letter to J. Duplan, dated 1 July 1858). Despite a certain number of corrections and marginal additions,  this is the completed version of the text, which ultimately was removed from the novel, even though information therefrom was scattered throughout the work. This chapter reveals the way the author works. He is distinguished by his encyclopedic erudition and his attention to detail, which shed light on the original challenges in the creation of <i>Salammbô</i>: that of reconstructing the then-lost city of Carthage. In November 1949, Martin Bodmer purchased this manuscript at the Blaizot bookstore.",

It is the oldest handwritten version of the <i>Kinder- und Hausmärchen</i> since the Brothers Grimm systematically destroyed all the preliminary work for their edition of the fairy tales, probably in order to prevent the comparison between the handwritten versions and the later printed edition (first edition 1812), which was thoroughly revised and expressed in literary form. According to an analysis by Heinz Rölleke (Rölleke Heinz (ed.), Die älteste Märchensammlung der Brüder Grimm. Synopse der handschriftlichen Urfassung von 1810 und der Erstdrucke von 1812, Cologny-Genève 1975), 25 fairy tales were written by Jacob Grimm, 14 by Wilhelm Grimm (partly with addenda by his brother), and 7 can be attributed to four other authors.

Hugo movingly denounces the condition of prostitutes: he actually invites the reader to sympathize with rather than despise the “fallen women”. This symbolic vocabulary, usually denoting moral depravity, is used here not to convey a fault, but to express the courage of women who long struggled against the inevitability of the burden of misery before succumbing to it. Far from a moralizing Manicheism, Hugo assigns faults generally attributed to these women also to “à toi, riche ! à ton or”, pointing a finger at the injustice of a social system lacking any distribution of wealth as well as “à nous”, each citizen whose regard is not charitable enough. This manuscript presents a slight variation of the printed text since it reads: “s’y retenir longtemps de leurs mains épuisées” instead of “s’y cramponner longtemps”.",

Hugo himself crossed out the original title „Impératrice“ for being too obvious. The text is addressed to the wife of Napoleon III, Eugenia de Montijo, whom Hugo reproaches for her „bigoterie“ (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/ms-Hugo-H-071-003/3r\">3r</a>) and her „signe de croix grotesque à l’espagnole“ (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/ms-Hugo-H-071-003/1r\">1r</a>). Thus he extends to the spouse the criticism of Napoleon III that he had already presented in the <i>Châtiments</i>. The date of October 11, 1869, in Hugo’s own handwriting, suggests that the text was created in Brussels, where Hugo lived in exile since the coup of December 2, 1851.",

Hugo surprises this pure soul in the midst of adversity, invoking the help of the Lord to save her from overwhelming sadness. In this last part (VI), the writer increases his Christian support (<i>Votre âme qui bientôt fuira peut-être ailleurs / Vers les régions pures, / Et vous emportera plus loin que nos douleurs, Plus loin que nos murmures !</i>) with an angelic and serene quatrain: <i>Soyez comme l'oiseau, posé pour un instant / Sur des rameaux trop frêles, / Qui sent ployer la branche et qui chante pourtant, / Sachant qu'il a des ailes !</i>",

Although the painter often was very sparing in his use of paper, for these few lines he used a large and beautiful in-folio sheet, folded and glued together (to add more thickness). Writing in a humanist script close to calligraphy, he showed particular care for the layout, using line spacing and indentations to reinforce the customary architecture of the <i>sonetto</i>. His tone is very respectful: Michelangelo greets not only a friend, but also a lady who is part of high society and who has given him a valuable gift. This gift, which was to take its beneficiary \"<i>in paradiso</i>”, must have been a manuscript of the <i>Sonetti spirituali</i> of the poet (who in general was very discreet and only rarely showed her verses).",

As to the threat posed by the Reformed, Malherbe judges them to be near the end: \"<i>la Huguenoterie court fortune par toute l’Europe d’estre voisine de sa fin</i>.\"",

As a theater enthusiast, he read aloud Voltaire’s <i>La Mort de César</i> to his entourage several times. He decided to write his own play on the same subject; this manuscript in Napoleon’s own handwriting presents a quick sketch of the first two scenes.

Written on the recto side of a page are three sections numbered with Roman numerals from II to IV\r\nand, with the exception of the last one (IV), titled. Although the text is\r\nwritten in prose, the designation “sonnet” (II) could be due to the form of the\r\nexcerpt in question, which is presented in 14 lines. The first section contains\r\nthe sign +, which is difficult to interpret and which gives the impression that\r\nRimbaud had planned to rework it. The numbering suggests that these three\r\nsections form a homogeneous whole together with the section <i>Dimanche</i> (I, BNF manuscript), thus constituting the poem <i>Jeunesse</i>. One can see inscriptions by other hands from after 1886: the annotation <i>Illuminations</i> in the upper left corner deliberately refers to the collection of poems with that same title, which was originally published in 1886. The poem <i>Jeunesse</i>, which consists of four stanzas, was first published by Vanier in 1895, after the <i>Poésies complètes</i>, as a complement to the <i>Illuminations</i>.",

Vellay (purchased by Martin Bodmer in 1926) and contains a draft of two passages from the <i>Lettres</i>. The first of these was published in the original edition (Amsterdam, M. M.

            "Summary (English)" : "The <i>Mémoire présenté à M. de Mably sur l’éducation de M. son fils</i> is Rousseau’s first writing related to his experience as an educator. In 1740 he took up a difficult position as tutor in the family of the notable Jean Bonnot de Mably, provost general of police in the Lyon region. This position came to an end after only one year. Two young children with little inclination to study had been entrusted to his care: François-Paul-Marie Bonnot de Mably, called Monsieur de Sainte-Marie, five and a half years old, and Jean-Antoine Bonnot de Mably, called Monsieur de Condillac, four and a half years old. The long <i>Mémoire</i>, dedicated to the older boy, emphasizes the “educational mission” and experience with practical education: it is presented as a plan and a synthesis; its writing has been dated around December 1740. The young tutor addresses M. de Mably and makes known to him the plan and structure for the education of his son in order to shape “the heart, the judgment and the spirit.” This is not the natural education, which later on will be advocated in ’<i>Émile</i>. Did Rousseau really present this <i>Mémoire</i> to M. de Mably? Known is only that he gave this manuscript of the <i>Mémoire</i> to Mme Dupin, his employer in 1743, and that since then it has been kept with the “Papers of Mme Dupin.” It was published for the first time in Paris in 1884 by G. de Villeneuve-Guibert in <i>Le portefeuille de Madame Dupin</i>. The Fondation Bodmer’s manuscript is the only one in existence. A <i>Projet d’éducation</i>, much shorter, more clearly structured and of unknown date, was found among Rousseau’s papers at the time of his death (this manuscript, now lost, was first published in Geneva in 1782). It is very similar to the <i>Mémoire</i> and seems to have been written",

The poet had submitted his original work to various humanists and high-ranking scholars, and he took into consideration certain critiques and suggestions when editing his verses during the summer of 1576. Several stanzas were profoundly revised or even completely rewritten. Stanza 42 was one of the most reworked, to the point that Tasso had to paste this small strip of paper with the definitive version of the text into the manuscript. The text describes the attitude and thoughts of the Muslim princess Armide, who gets ready to harangue the caliph and his armies and incite them to fight to the death with the crusaders and thus to take revenge on the Christian hero Rinaldo, who had abandoned her.",

This story of a conversion is more than an authentic Christian legend (then attributed to Saint John of Damascus) — it is above all a Christianized story. In the prince, who first gives up his palace in order to learn about the plagues of the world and then leaves his throne for the meditative life of an ascetic, one certainly recognizes Buddha. The edifying Christian story, set at the banks of the Ganges, is nothing other than an adaptation of <i>Vie du Bodhisattva</i>, a 2nd-4th century Sanskrit text, which over centuries was translated and adapted first by the Manichaeans, then by the Arabs, Georgians and Byzantines, until it finally reached the far distant people of the Western World: Lope de Vega’s work thus (without the author’s having been aware of this) is part of one of the  most impressive chains of intellectual transmission in history.",

Each life is introduced with a large rubricated initial, and numerous glosses and <i>maniculae</i> by Heinrich von Ligerz were inserted along the margins. The original endpapers, now removed, left traces of a liturgical text with neumes on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/sbe/0250/bindingE\">inside of the cover</a> and traces of an illuminated initial on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/sbe/0250/bindingF\">inside of the back cover</a>.",

Evidence of heavy use indicates that these manuscripts remained in use into the 17th century, that is, until the liturgical reform of the Council of Trent.

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript was produced in the Convent of Dominican Sisters of St. Verena in Zurich in 1449. In addition to the life of Benedict following Gregory’s <i>Dialogi</i>, in a unique translation that seems to exist only in this codex (according to Werner Williams-Krapp), the manuscript contains translations of three more legends of 13th century Dominican saints. These as well are attested only in this codex, have practically never been studied, and have not even been edited. First there is one of three versions of the translation of the <i>Vita S. Dominici</i> by Dietrich of Apolda; then there is the translation of Thomas Agno de Lentino's <i>Legenda maior</i> about the Inquisitor Peter of Milan (also know as Peter Martyr or Peter of Verona), who was killed in 1252; attached to this is the bull of his canonization issued by Pope Innocent IV in 1253. It is noteworthy that the translation of the bull also contains a legend of Peter which, according to Regina D. Schiewer, is independent of the one by Thomas Agno. If the translations of these legends into Alemannic that are contained in Cod. 671 were in fact created around 1300, as assumed by Schwierer, then the (abbreviated?) version of the translation of the life of Dominic contained in Cod. 671 would constitute the earliest proof of the presence of the revelations of Mechthild of Magdeburg in Southwestern Germany, as the final chapter of the fifth book of the life of Dominic (cf. fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/sbe/0671/80v\">80v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/sbe/0671/82r\">82r</a>) is based on excerpts from the Latin translation of <i>Das Fließende Licht der Gottheit</i>.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Engelberg 52 is a late eleventh-century handbook of canon law from the circle of Bernold of Constance († 1100), an ardent champion of Pope Gregory VII. It comprises various canonistic compilations: the 'Collection in Seventy-Four Titles' (<i>Collectio 74 titulorum</i> with the so-called 'Swabian Appendix' (<i>Appendix svevica</i>; two short collections 'On Churches' (<i>De ecclesiis</i>) and 'On Illicit Unions' (<i>De illicitis coniunctionibus</i>); the Pseudo-Gelasian decretal 'On Books to be Received and not to be Received' (<i>De libris recipiendis et non recipiendis</i>); the 'Canons of the Four Principal Councils' prefaced by 'Adnotation I' (<i>Adnotatio I</i>; and the <i>Epitome Hadriani</i> prefaced by 'Adnotation II' (<i>Adnotatio II</i>). All of these items can also be found in two closely related manuscripts (St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0676\">Cod.

Prefixed to the whole is a catalogue of popes extending from Peter I to Leo IX with the addition of Victor II. Though it acknowledges Henry III’s role in the appointment of four popes (from Clement II to Victor II), it was possibly the source of the papal catalogue that Bernold attached to his Chronicle (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 432, fols. <a href=\"http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00039847/image_27\">10r</a>–<a href=\"http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00039847/image_31\">12r</a>).",

The manuscript contains the entire winter portion of the Temporale, of the Sanctorale and of the Commune Sanctorum according to the liturgy of the Diocese of Lausanne. The book decoration with miniatures for numerous initials is attributed to the Master of the breviary of Jost von Silenen, an itinerant artist who was active in Fribourg, Bern, Sion and later in Ivrea and Aosta. He got his name from a breviary in two volumes that was created around 1493 for the Bishop of Sion, Jost of Silenen (1482-1496).\nAfter the introduction of the Reformation to Bern in the year 1528 and the subsequent secularization of the chapter, the entire group of antiphonaries was sold in 1530: four were sold to the city of Estavayer-le-Lac and were used there for the liturgy of the Collegiate Church of St. Lorenz; the other two — among them a duplicate of this manuscript — reached Vevey under circumstances that remain unexplained.

It governs the relations of associates in the law courts, at the princely court, and in communal landholdings within a court district (here the lower court of Burgau near Flawil) with the lord of that court, the \"Vogt\" (reeve). At the time this was Rudolf IX Giel of Glattburg, a ministry official of the abbot of St. Gall Abbey. Originally the Burgau Offnung was part of a single volume together with those of <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/gf/FlawOf\">Flawil</a>, Gebhartschwil, Uffhoven and Rudlen. The <i>Flawil Offnung</i> (up to page <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/gf/FlawOf/17v\">17</a>) was removed and bound separately. Preceding the text of the <i>Burgau Offnung</i> on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/gf/BurgOf/18r\">pp. 18</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/gf/BurgOf/28v\">28</a> were those of the Offnung of <i>gebhartschwil, uffhoven und rudeln</i>. The book was entrusted to the respective “Ammann” (head of the district council) of Burgau of the time. After 1798, following the dissolution of the lower court, the book transferred to the village corporation of Burgau. After consolidation of Burgau with Flawil, the book came into the custody of the municipality of Flawil.",

            "Summary (English)" : "The <i>Flawil Offnung</i> of 1471, sealed on 21 January 1472, is a medieval law book. It governs the relations of associates in the law courts, at the princely court, and in communal landholdings within a court district (here the lower court of Flawil) with the lord of that court, the \"Vogt\" (reeve). At the time this was Rudolf IX Giel of Glattburg, a ministry official of the abbot of St. Gall Abbey. This document provides an insight into the legal and economic situation towards the end of the 15th century. Originally the <i>Flawil Offnung</i> was part of a single volume together with those of Gebhartschwil, Uffhoven and Rudlen (Aufhofen and Rudeln) as well as <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/gf/BurgOf\">Burgau</a>. Later the <i>Flawil Offnung</i> (up to page 17) was removed. Due to the dissolution of the lower court, after 1798 the <i>Flawil Offnung</i> was transferred to the citizens’ corporation or today’s municipality of Flawil. ",

Calendar with the signs of the zodiac and with agricultural tasks to be carried out in each month. Particularly worthy of emphasis are the full-page representations of St. Christopher (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/176\">p. 176</a>), of the Adoration of the Magi (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/178\">p. 178</a>), and of Christ on the Cross (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/179\">p. 179</a>). Based on the mention of saints in the calendar and in the rest of the manuscript, it was probably created in Besançon. From there, by unexplained means, it came into the possession of the patrician family Wallier of Solothurn: owners’ entries by Guillaume Wallier (16th century) and Henri Wallier (1605) on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/4\">p. 4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/731\">p. 731</a>, the latter’s also on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/binding/kbt/y024/bindingE/\">front cover</a>. On p. 90 of the 1858 catalogue of the cantonal library of Thurgau, the provenance is given as Fischingen. Possibly the mansucript reached Fischingen by means of one of the two abbots of Fischingen from Solothurn, Augustin Bloch from Oberbuchsitten (1776-1815) or the last Abbot of Fischingen, Franz Fröhlicher from Bellach (1836- 1848).",

These objects themselves disappeared without a trace in 1822, with the exception of three ceremonial robs of the Order of the Golden Fleece (which are now on display in the castle of Gruyère). The book contains 42 illustrations: 3 frontispieces show the coats of arms of the city, its bailiwicks, and the coats of arms of the members of the Executive Council; 30 illustrations reproduce the banners and 9 illustrations portray Burgundian clothing items and tapestries. The “Book of Flags” is an art object, valuable as a record of objects that have been lost, as well as a witness to the fame of the Fribourg troops in the late Middle Ages.",

Peter Schneuwly (1540-1597) can be considered the author; he himself probably went to school in Fribourg. From 1557 on, he studied in Freiburg im Breisgau, where he attained a <i>Magister artium</i>. From 1564 on, he was a member of the clergy of the Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas in Fribourg, in 1565 he became a canon, and in 1566 a preacher in the city. At this time, the first preparatory works for the “Katharinenbuch” took shape. In the years 1577-1597, Schneuwly was vicar general of the Diocese of Lausanne, from 1578-1587 also provost of St. Nicholas. The “Katharinenbuch” also constitutes the charter of the “Scholarchenkammer” (chamber of scholarchs) of the city of Fribourg, in whose possession it remained until the 19th century. The school reform sought by Schneuwly never went into effect because in 1580, also on Schneuwly’s initiative, the Jesuits were called to Fribourg and were entrusted with secondary education.",

Indeed, the general chapter of the Cistercians decided in 1236 to have the name of the saint, who was canonized the previous year, entered into the martyrology and into the calendar of the order. The corresponding entry in our manuscript’s calendar, by a second hand, is probably a consequence of this decision.",

In this form, the missal could have served the celebrant for both the conventual mass and for the private mass that Cistercians are known to have held since their origins. The geographical origin of the codex has not been determined with certainty. Without doubt, however, from the fifteenth century onward it was at Hauterive, where it was re-bound. The rich decoration in the canon section provide a fine example of fleuronné initials from the end of the thirteenth century; here, the decoration of the scrolls seems to be still “domesticated” by rigorous framing.” (Joseph Leisibach, <i>Liturgica Friburgensia.

It goes by the title <i>Fabulae moralizatate</i> and consists of 122 Latin fables taken from various sources from antiquity, presented in the form of dialogs. Magninus Mediolanensis (d. 1376) and Nicolaus Pergamenus are identified as the authors.

Friedrich was able to assemble these copies of the texts by either copying or purchasing them while studying in Strassburg, Paris, and Avignon. ",

The manuscript contains 27 of Cicero’s speeches, written in a round\r\nItalian humanistic script.

It is likely that Péronet Lamy carried out this decoration when he was at\r\nthe Council of Basel as part of the Duke’s entourage. Also present there was\r\nMartin le Franc (1408-1461), ducal secretary and author of the <i>Champion des Dames</i> and the\r\n<i>Estrif de fortune et de vertu</i>; according to a scraped entry (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0101/290r/0/Sequence-2574\">290r</a>), he came into\r\npossession of this manuscript.

The script is Carolingian minuscule and the initials are decorated with gold, silver, and minium. This manuscript may have been written and illuminated by Sintram at the beginning of the 10th century. The original binding was made of ivory. The manuscript apparently left St. Gall at the end of the 18th century, after being offered for sale. It only appeared again in the 1860s, when the heirs of Geneva physician Jean-Jaques de Roches-Lombard presented it to the Bibliothèque de Genève.",

They are a complete group of liturgical manuscripts consisting of a sacramentary, an epistolary, an evangeliary, a gradual, a tropary-sequentiary, a gradual-hymnal, a hymnal and the <i>Ordo missae</i>. The present copy is very similar to the one from Einsiedeln, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/sbe/0040\">Cod. 40(481)</a>‬‬ (before 950).

These copies of 150 documents (with 21 translations) do not render the originals in chronological order, but are instead ordered by topic. They were written by various scribes of the Lucerne chancery and go up to the year 1492.

The author probably did not come from an academic background, but must rather have been a medical practitioner. In this sense, the volume can be characterized as a “house book of folk medicine”, probably the oldest of its kind. It is also considered the oldest source for the so-called “iatromathematical corpus”.",

As a general of the Order of the Hieronymites (since 1457), but also as a close confidant and adviser of King Henry IV of Castile (1454-1474), Alonso advocated a tolerant attitude towards converted Jews. In 1450, he began writing the <i>'Lumen ad revelationem gentium et gloria plebis Dei Israel' - De unitate fidei et de concordia et pacifica equalitate fidelium</i> (f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/1r\">1</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/203v\">203</a>, Tabula <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/204r\">204</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/207r\">207</a>); in 1465, he dedicated the completed book of 52 chapters to the Archbishop Alfonso Carrillo of Toledo (1410-1485). The announced second part of the work apparently was never written.In 1979, Luis A. Diaz y Diaz prepared a Spanish translation based on the three manuscripts then known. The present manuscript has not yet been acknowledged in research; it thus constitutes the fourth manuscript known so far. It was certainly written still in the 15th century and is made up of parchment and paper leaves. Despite its significance, no Latin text edition of the work has yet been prepared.",

The event described is said to have occurred in the time of Abbess Adelheid I (1211-1233). According to the account, important to the history of piety, the nun Agnes, daughter of a knight from Sent in the lower Engadine, received the Eucharistic Host one Holy Thursday, with a dubious conscience; she did not eat it however, hiding it instead in her veil and then storing it in her little chest. Thereafter the host transformed into flesh and blood. This is the origin of the pilgrimage to the Holy Blood at Müstair.

In his <i>Dictionnaire de musique</i>, Rousseau takes up again the approximately four hundred articles he had written in 1749 for the <i>Encyclopédie</i>. Starting in 1753, in answer to attacks and criticism brought on by his articles, he begins to revise and rewrite them. Because he strives for lexicographic completeness in the field of music, the author composes more and more new entries, reaching close to nine hundred terms. In 1794 the manuscript is donated to the Neuchâtel Library by Pierre-Alexandre DuPeyrou (1729-1794) from Neuchâtel, Rousseau’s friend and publisher.",

The booklet FiD 1 (French musical notation) contains the oldest offices of St. Bernard and of the\r\nTrinity, which were introduced into the order in 1175 or shortly thereafter.\r\nThe flyleaves are remarkable as well. Together with <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/fdr/0002\">FiD 2</a>, they represent\r\nrelics of antiphonaries that were copied around 1136/1140 and contain the\r\noriginal Cistercian liturgy, which was copied shortly after 1108 in Metz by\r\nmonks sent by Abbot Stephen Harding. This liturgy was corrected within the\r\nframework of the reforms of Bernard of Clairvaux. The existence of Bernardine\r\ndrafts had until now been known through antiphonary 12A-B from Westmalle Abbey\r\n(Belgium) and through the one from Tamié Abbey 6 (Savoy).

Doubtlessly the parchment pieces of various sizes were glued together by the nuns of Fille-Dieu in order to cover a now lost liturgical formulary. Together, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/fdr/0001\">FiD 1</a> and FiD 2 constitute relics of antiphonaries that contained the primitive Cistercian liturgy. This was defined by Fr. Kovacs (“Fragments du chant cistercien primitif“, ASOC 6 [1950], pp. 140–150) and Chr. Waddell (The Primitive Cistercian Breviary, Fribourg, 2007 [Spicilegium Friburgense 44]) as the liturgy reformed by Stephen Harding shortly after 1108. During this reform, the abbot of Cîteaux forced the order to adopt the antiphonary of Metz, which was in use by the order until the time of the second reform under Bernard of Clairvaux. This second reform was completed in the early 1140s. The existence of Bernardine drafts had until now been known through antiphonary 12A-B from Westmalle Abbey (Belgium) and through the one from Tamié Abbey 6 (Savoy). Codicological analysis of the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fdr/0001/V1r/0/Sequence-2560\">flyleaves of FiD 1</a> and of the fragments of FiD 2 reveals that all pieces come from the Swiss Abbey of Fille-Dieu; they share identical status and common characteristics, irrespective of current holding sites.

In addition, f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fdr/0005/98v/0/Sequence-2575\">98v</a> contains no mention of an octave of St. Bernard, which is usually included in all Cistercian books from 1295 on. A study of the musical and liturgical content shows that manuscript FiD 5, which is a faithful copy of the older Gradual of the order (Abbazia Tre Fontane 47, around 1140/1143), probably originated in Hautcrêt Abbey (Oron VD), which was the motherhouse of Fille-Dieu until 1536.",

Converging indicators, such as the statements by Chiampell (Placidus Plattner, Ulrici Campelli Historia raetica, Basel, Schneider, T. 2 1890, 353), as well as the orthography and the language of the transcriptions suggest that this is the only surviving copy of the Joseph-drama by Chiampell himself, which was performed in Susch in 1564. At the end of the manuscript, there is a conversation between a Protestant pastor and a sick person (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/75r/0/Sequence-2592\">75</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/77v/0/Sequence-2592\">77</a>), as well as several prayers (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/78r/0/Sequence-2592\">78</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/80v/0/Sequence-2592\">80</a>), which were translated from the German by the scribe of the text, Baltasar Valantin.",

It is called the “White Book” because it was originally bound in a white pigskin cover. It contains copies of privileges, alliances, and important decisions by the courts of arbitration and the <i>Landesgemeinden</i> beginning in 1316, and was written for the most part in the years 1470/1471. It is the most important cartulary from the Obwalden Chancellery during the late Middle Ages and, as such, is still part of the city archives today. However, this book is famous above all because it contains the oldest version of the story of the founding of the Swiss Confederation on a mere 25 pages (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/staow/A02CHR0003/441\">pp. 441</a>–<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/staow/A02CHR0003/465\">465</a>).

Based on the entries in Latin, German, French and English, it is possible to reconstruct two trips that Fisher took to London, during which most of the dedications occurred: 1747-1750 via Geneva, Lyon, Paris to London and 1758 via Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Amsterdam to London. Several entries are by members of the Schalch family of Schaffhausen, who were relatives of Fischer; among these is an undated watercolor by the artist Johann Jakob Schalch (1723-1789) (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kgfs/0144-0032/122\">122</a>), who lived in London and Den Haag from 1754-1773.
