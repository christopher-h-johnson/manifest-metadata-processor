            "Summary (English)" : "\"Codex Florus dispersus” contains a virtual reconstruction of a manuscript of letters and sermons by Augustine. It was written by a single hand in a late 7th or early 8th century uncial script. The manuscript evidently originated in France, perhaps in Luxeuil or in Lyon. Originally the manuscript contained at least 30 quinions (at least 300 leaves), of which 117 leaves remain today. One part with 63 leaves from the original quires 4-11 is currently held in Paris (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bnf/lat11641\">BnF, lat. 11641</a>); after leaf 26 there could be inserted a single leaf which currently is held in St. Petersburg (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/nlr/lat-F-I-1\">NLR, Lat.F.papyr. I.1</a>). Another part with 53 leaves from the original quires 24-30 is being held in Geneva (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bge/lat0016\">Bibliothèque de Genève, lat. 16</a>). The outer leaf of each quire (quinio) is parchment, while the remaining leaves are papyrus. During the 9th century the volume was part of the library of Florus of Lyon, who added numerous marginalia to the manuscript in his own hand. \"sine loco\", codices restituti, Cod. 1 contains a virtual reconstruction of the surviving pieces in their original order.",

It contains the first (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bke/0020/6r\">6r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bke/0020/99r\">99r</a>)  and second part (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bke/0020/99r\">99r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bke/0020/193v\">193v</a>), each  divided into five books. At the front of the volume there used to be a full-page illustration consisting of an artistic portrayal of Job with his three friends (upper half) and a portrayal of Gregory the Great and a writing monk (lower half), who according to custom represents Peter the Deacon (Petrus Diaconus). This leaf with a verse of dedication by Frowin on the back, the actual recto side, was carefully described by P. Karl Stadler in his hand-written catalog of 1787; this helped to identify the <i>membrum disiectum</i>, which is now held by the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cma/1955-74\">The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1955.74</a> (Purchase from the J.H.
