            "Summary (English)" : "\"Codex Florus dispersus” contains a virtual reconstruction of a manuscript of letters and sermons by Augustine. It was written by a single hand in a late 7th or early 8th century uncial script. The manuscript evidently originated in France, perhaps in Luxeuil or in Lyon. Originally the manuscript contained at least 30 quinions (at least 300 leaves), of which 117 leaves remain today. One part with 63 leaves from the original quires 4-11 is currently held in Paris (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bnf/lat11641\">BnF, lat. 11641</a>); after leaf 26 there could be inserted a single leaf which currently is held in St. Petersburg (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/nlr/lat-F-I-1\">NLR, Lat.F.papyr. I.1</a>). Another part with 53 leaves from the original quires 24-30 is being held in Geneva (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/bge/lat0016\">Bibliothèque de Genève, lat. 16</a>). The outer leaf of each quire (quinio) is parchment, while the remaining leaves are papyrus. During the 9th century the volume was part of the library of Florus of Lyon, who added numerous marginalia to the manuscript in his own hand. \"sine loco\", codices restituti, Cod. 1 contains a virtual reconstruction of the surviving pieces in their original order.",

At the front of the volume there used to be a full-page illustration consisting of an artistic portrayal of Job with his three friends (upper half) and a portrayal of Gregory the Great and a writing monk (lower half), who according to custom represents Peter the Deacon (Petrus Diaconus). This leaf with a verse of dedication by Frowin on the back, the actual recto side, was carefully described by P. Karl Stadler in his hand-written catalog of 1787; this helped to identify the <i>membrum disiectum</i>, which is now held by the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/cma/1955-74\">The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1955.74</a> (Purchase from the J.H.

It was written by private initiative between 1510 and 1535 and took as its model primarily the Official Bernese Chronicle - <i>Amtliche Berner Chronik</i> - by Diebold Schilling and the Chronicle - <i>Kronica</i> - by Petermann Etterlin. This volume, the third and last of the Chronicle, presents the events of the Burgundian Wars and the Swabian War; it ends with the Italian military campaigns, among others the Battle of Marignano on September 13th and 14th 1515, in which presumably the author himself took part. The volume is illustrated with 196 uncolored pen sketches by an anonymous artist. Today the three volumes are held in different libraries: the first volume is in the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/lsb/Ms0062\">Leopold-Sophien-Bibliothek in Überlingen</a>, the second in the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/stab/0002\">City Archives in Bremgarten</a>, and the third in the Cantonal Library of Aargau.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript contains, among others, prayers by Johannes von Indersdorf for Duke William III of Bavaria, the seven Penitential Psalms, as well as texts on the passion and the deposition of Christ. The major part of the prayer book was written in the years 1534 and 1540, more prayers filled in blank sections until the 1560s. The exact provenance of the manuscript is unknown, but the written language as well as the textual tradition suggest the East Upper German-speaking area (the region of Bavaria/Austria). The prayer book receives its name from Elisabeth Blumin, deceased 23 May 1550, who is mentioned at the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/A-XI-0064/105v\">end</a>, and who may have been the first owner of this manuscript.",

The commentaries were copied around the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th century, a project that did not provide for miniatures on the frontispiece. These were added a short time later, together with a prologue. The codex still retains the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/AN-I-0008/bindingA\">binding</a> that was created in Constantinople between 1435 and 1437 during a restoration for its new owner, the Dominican John of Ragusa, who brought the codex to Basel in 1437.",

They were originally created in the 14th century as two separate pieces; later they were bound together into the current volume at the Carthusian monastery of Basel, whose library owned the manuscript from the 15th century on. Still in the 14th century, a German translation of <i>De VII gradibus contemplationis</i> was added as a supplement to the second part. Probably only at the time of binding the manuscript was the beginning of the <i>Abstractum-</i>Glossars added as a <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/B-IX-0025/102r/0/Sequence-2637\">last page</a>, bound in upside down; the transcription of this text also dates from the 14th century and therefore could not have been produced at the monastery. ",

The main text, decorated with artistic initials with gold leaf as well as fleuronné initials, is closely surrounded by commentary in marginal and interlinear glosses, written in a small, compact semi-Gothic script. Bound into this volume as the second part is Aristotle’s <i>De animalibus</i>, printed in Venice in 1476; this text’s uncharacteristic lack of decoration at least raises the question of whether it was also part of Heynlin’s library.",

The leather <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/F-III-0015e/bindingA\">binding</a>, presumably still Carolingian, was much changed at a later time, especially due to the removal of the covers.

Sayyid Ǧalāladdīn Mazīd Bahādur is named as the person who commissioned the manuscript; he probably was part of the local upper class. Interspersed in the text are quotations from the Koran, prayers and poems; an appendix gives exact death dates for three people who passed away in the year 869 h. and who may have been part of the circle of the man who commissioned the manuscript. The decoration of the manuscript is incomplete, as can be seen from an only partially completed rosette (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/M-V-0005/3r/0/Sequence-2635\">3r</a>) and a missing family tree (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ubb/M-V-0005/26v/0/Sequence-2635\">26v</a>).

The decoration with initials and miniatures (e.g., the birth of Christ, the entry into Jerusalem, or the depiction of the resurrection) refer to the respective liturgical holiday, whereas the initial for <i>Ecce advenit dominator dominus</i> wrongly depicts the presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Its decoration places this gradual in the later circle of the so-called “Vullenhoe-group”.",

But after the Reformation, travel for the sake of education became more common, in Basel as well; its main purpose was an interest in Italy itself and its sights. With this, there came to be travelogues like this one from 1621 by the jurist and rector of the University of Basel, Remigius Faesch (1595-1667).",

The text, an epic poem in Latin in about 1700 distichs that has survived only in this manuscript, is divided into three books. The first two books describe the prehistory of Sicily and its conquest by the Staufers; the third book contains a poem in praise of the parents — Emperor Henry VI and his wife Constance, daughter and heir of King Roger II of Sicily — of the famous Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II, who was born on 26 December 1194 in Jesi near Ancona.",

The book decoration is a superb example of pre-Carolingian manuscript illustration from the Frankish Empire and Northern Italy. From the detailed information on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bbb/0219/1r\">title page</a>, one can deduce that the text was written in 699; the Bernese Chronicle of Eusebius therefore is Switzerland’s oldest dated manuscript.",

Lupus received the arithmetic book (<i>Calculus</i>) by Victorius of Aquitaine along with a now widely known model alphabet for Ancient Capitals.

(He should not be confused with his contemporary Leoniceno Niccolò [1428-1524], a physician, philosopher and professor in Ferrara.) This manuscript has a key role in cultural history, as the texts by Theoprastus and most of the Aristotelian texts it contains served as the basis for the Aldine edition of 1497. Similarly, it served as the basis for the translation of Aristotle's <i>Mechanica</i> published by the manuscript's owner in 1525 in Venice. In the margin of the manuscript one can see the efforts of Nicolaus Thomaeus to devise figures to illustrate the translation.",

Most of the close to thirty individual pieces are texts from grammatical, patristic, computistic and medical works. The longer pieces are interspersed with further excerpts, partly written in Tironian notes. One quaternio from the only partially preserved third part is today held in Paris (BN lat. 10756). Noteworthy is the palimpsest in the fifth part, whose undertexts were probably written in Italy in the 7th century and in the second half of the 5th century respectively.",

The first two were copied in Paris, probably around the end of the 15th century, by the famous professor of Greek, Georgius Hermonymus of Sparta (†1511-1516). They contain prayers and liturgical pieces, particularly from the Abbey of Saint Denis in France, including an as yet apparently unpublished translation of a Mass formula for Saints Dionysius, Rusticus and Elutherius into Greek. The last part, an addition to the others, is the work of a single hand, very similar in appearance to that of Hermonymous, perhaps that of one of his pupils.",

Presumably the Bernese merchant Jörg Friburger commissioned the manuscript in 1467 from the scribe Johann Stemhein of Konstanz, who edited and stylistically modernized the text of his model to match the tastes of a late medieval urban public. In addition, he gave directions for illustrations, which were later executed by a painter who created 28 colored pen and ink drawings. The further history of this manuscript,which today consists of 180 leaves, is unknown; it must, however, have reached the Bernese municipal library in the early years of the 19th century, where it is attested at least since 1816.",

The compilation of the cartulary began around 1202 and was completed in 1242; 5 files, dated 1250-1294, were added later. The material structure of the manuscript is very complex because of numerous additions to the original core, which corresponds to the <i>Livre censier du Chapitre cathédral de Lausanne</i> of about 1202. The manuscript contains various texts: the Annals of Lausanne, a topographic cartulary, a chronological register, two chronicles, an urbarium, the Chronicle of the Bishops of Lausanne and the Cathedral’s necrology. The author of this valuable collection is Conon d’Estavayer (before 1200-1243/1244), who became Dean of the Cathedral in 1202. From 1216 until 1242, he directly supervised the editing of the manuscript and the organization of the documents.",

It was probably written shortly after the original, and thus it is the oldest Romansh document preserved in the original. The alliance of 1544 is a renewal of the alliance between the Grey League, the League of the Ten Jurisdictions and the League of God's House of 23 September 1524, which is generally considered the founding act of the Free State of the Three Leagues. The dating of the manuscript is uncertain since the date 11 November 1544 refers to the German document, which, however, does not bear the signature of Friedrich von Salis. According to the note of confirmation of 8 February 1605, the manuscript must at least have been written prior to this date.",

After the fall of the monarchy in 1792, the comedy was again performed on several Parisian stages, albeit the concluding songs were modified by Beaumarchais. The final stanza of the stuttering judge Don Gusman Brid’oison, which in 1784 had concluded <i>Tout fini-it par des chansons</i>, was adapted to the difficulties of the period: <i>Pour tromper sa maladie, / Il</i> [the people] <i>chantoit tout l’opera : / Dame ! il n’sait plus qu’ce p’tit air-là : / Ca ira, ça ira</i>... However, after the fall of Robespierre and the Thermidorian Reaction, these words roiled young Muscadins just as the previous ones had caused the Sansculottes to react. Since the performances were disrupted by such turbulent audiences, Beaumarchais entrusted La Rochelle, the actor who performed the role of Brid’Oison, with an alternative ending that could be recited <i>en cas de bruit</i> (in case of noise). This variant, which remained unpublished until recently, was a praise of freedom of speech and of the <i>sang froid de la raison</i> (the cold blood of reason) against the <i>stratagème</i> (wiles) of ideological cabals.",

            "Summary (English)" : "According to Beethoven, this is his “most accomplished work.” It\r\ncelebrates the consecration of his student and sponsor, Archduke Rudolph, as Archbishop of Olomouc (Olmütz) in 1818. This mass was begun in 1818; it was completed three years after the\r\nceremony and was presented to the cardinal and archbishop on 19 March 1823. This <i>mass in D major</i> seeks to express and communicate, in\r\nthe words of the composer himself, a state of mind, a religious <i>Stimmung</i>. It is written for a large orchestra and consists\r\nof five movements (<i>Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei</i>)  The sections of the <i>Gloria</i>, imposed by the meaning of the text, constitute a sonata: <i>allegro</i> in D major, <i>Gratias</i> in B flat and back to the <i>allegro</i>; then the <i>larghetto</i> and as a third movement the <i>allegro</i>, <i>Quoniam</i>, the fugue <i>In gloria Dei Patris</i>, with a cyclical return to the theme of the <i>Gloria</i> in the principal tone. The music comments on the text: royal acclamation, heartfelt gratitude, divine omnipotence; then, in contrast: prayers, shouts and murmurs of the supplicants of this world (<i>miserere nobis</i>). Purchased at Sotheby’s, London, 4 February 1952.  ",

It comprises various reference texts, which are systematically accompanied by the <i>Glossa ordinaria</i>, the so-called \"Magna glossa\" by Franciscus Accursius, an interlinear gloss and the gloss of the Gloss, which are works of explanation and instruction for the use of the text. Many manicules or fists (lat <i>manicula, ae</i>: small hands) testify to the assiduous labor which a large number of readers have performed on this dry text. This manuscript contains numerous pecia marks. A detached page (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0100/37ar\">f. 37bis</a>) contains a poem to the reader by the Italian jurist Angelus Boncambius (about 1450).",

            "Summary (English)" : "The two originally independent parts of this manuscript were bound together probably in the last third of the 15th century (after 1469, cf. Index p. Iv).

This part of the manuscript features marginal corrections and glosses (especially for medically relevant parts of the text), which may be by the original owner of the manuscript (Hayer 1998, p. 162). Especially parts I, III, IV, and V of the <i>Buch der Natur</i> contain marginal notes and interlinear glosses in a 15th century hand which reworks the natural history texts allegorically for preaching. Numerous smaller and larger marginal illustrations. The second part, written in two columns (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0103/274r\">pp. 274ra</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0103/307r\">307rb</a>) contains a medical compendium in six parts (childhood illnesses – illnesses due to the imbalance of the <i>humores</i> – diseases of the eyes – the plague, skin diseases, fever – surgery and wound care – venereal diseases, bone injuries, burns), Latin and German recipes and prescriptions, as well as a German table of contents.

The text of the <i>Lex Baiuvariorum</i> also contains legal terms in Old High German.\nIn 1789 the codex was acquired by Count Johann-Christian Solms, who resided in Klitschdorf Castle near Bunzlau (Silesia) - his coat of arms can be found on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0107/1r\">f. 1r</a> - which is why the codex is known in the literature as the \"Codex Klitschdorf\" or \"Codex Solmsianus.” In 1960 Martin Bodmer purchased this codex from the New York antiquarian book dealer H.

This heroic epic (<i>chanson de geste</i>) in rhymed decimeter and Alexandrines tells of the campaign of Charlemagne in Italy against the pagan king Agolant and his son Helmont. The Anglo-Norman manuscript held by the Fondation Martin Bodmer was produced in the 13th century and contains interlinear and marginal corrections, added in a second hand at a slightly later date than that in which the text was written. Because the additions were doubtless made with the help of a proofing manuscript, we can thus measure the complex effort that was required for the dissemination of this text.",

Several epigrams were added, probably at the same time period, but by a hand different from that of the principal scribe (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0114/41v/0/Sequence-2763\">41v</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0114/105v/0/Sequence-2763\">105v</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0114/132r/0/Sequence-2763\">132r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0114/133v/0/Sequence-2763\">133v</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0114/136v/0/Sequence-2763\">136v</a>). In the absence of a title page, the decoration is limited to a series of initials, created by two different artists; one with <i>bianchi girari</i>, the other with interlace on a background of gold, sometimes referred to as “a cappio annodato.“ Each epigram begins with a simple initial in blue. Produced in Northern Italy in the middle of the 15th century, the manuscript was verifiably in France since the 18th century, in the hands of the Jarente de Sénas family; later it was owned by Ambroise Firmin-Didot. During the 19th century, ownership changed several times before the manuscript became part of the collection of Martin Bodmer.",

Though it was created at a time when book printing had already proven its usefulness, this manuscript serves to demonstrate a high level of achievement in the calligraphic and illuminatory arts. Copied by Bartolomeo Sanvito, who also produced four other manuscripts of the <i>Canzoniere</i> and the <i>Triumphi</i> by Petrarch, CB 130 was written using a well-balanced, simplified script and refined illuminations. The beginning of the manuscript contains three full-page illustrations on parchment.",

The most important works of this Latin-Christian poet, born in the 4th century in Tarragona, have been collected in this manuscript from the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century, and they reflect the light of the word of God. One may read here, among other things, the famous <i>Psychomachia</i>, which portrays the struggle between the allegorical figures of vice and virtue, a lesson that had a profound influence upon medieval art and poetry.

This translation is also based on Lelio Manfredi’s Italian translation, completed in 1513. Diego de San Pedro is a Spanish pre-Renaissance poet and storyteller; perhaps he was of Hebrew origin but converted to Christianity. <i>Carcel de amor</i>, one of his two best-known novellas, is a sentimental romance about the overcoming of passionate love through reason; it was first printed in Seville in 1492 and was translated into many languages. The manuscript is illustrated with 19 vignettes, most of which are surrounded by an architectural frame containing representations of figures in period clothing. This manuscript might have been created for Charles III de Bourbon-Montpensier (Charles de Bourbon) between 1521 and 1527 — his coat of arms is on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0149/1v\">f. 1v</a>.

It contains some marginal glosses that originate in part in the commentary of Lactance, and is distinguished above all by its neumes, which stand above the verses on fols. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0154/46v\">46v</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0154/80r\">80r</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0154/81r\">81r</a>. The notation indicates the rhythem of the text and underscore the importance of some passages that have a pathetic tone: the mourning of Hypsipyle over the body of the child Archemorus, the prayer of Tydeus shortly before death, the pain of Polyneikes before the body of Tydeus.",

This work, written near the end of the life of the great Dominican is incomplete, as its compositon was broken off by the death of the author. Organized in the form of questions (<i>quaestiones</i>) and subdivided into articles, the work presents theology in an organic form. Manuscript CB161 was produced in France, certainly in Paris, only a short time after the philosopher's death; it has been preserved in its original binding. The inscription from the end of the 13th century which can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/binding/fmb/cb-0161/bindingF\">lower portion of the back cover</a> shows that the manuscript was deposited as collateral by Jean de Paris against the loan of another work.

Pellegrin, following Tammaro de Marinis, attributes the writing to the copyist Gian Marco Cinico, who worked for the kings of Naples between 1458 and 1494. The different parts are introduced by golden initials with <i>bianchi girari</i>, only partly completed (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0172/1v\">1v</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0172/4v\">4v</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0172/20r\">20r</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0172/22r\">22r</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0172/50r\">50r</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0172/186v\">186v</a>). Some of these <i>bianchi girari</i> are left unfilled on a blue, red, green or black background, others are colored pink, green or blue on a black or golden background. The vine scrolls are inhabited by putti and animals such as rabbits, stags, butterflies or birds.

Manuscript copies of the work were frequently made; it was issued in print and translated into many languages. It enjoyed great popularity in Europe. The French translation by Laurent de Premierfait for Jean de Berry was equally popular, as evidenced by the 68 manuscript copies of this text still in existence. Unlike the Latin version, the French manuscripts display a rich iconographic accompaniment, most likely produced by Laurent de Premierfait himself. This is also the case with CB 174, which was produced during the 15th century in France. Each book opens with a small illustration (150 in all) portraying the “pitfalls” described in the text that follows.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Exemplar of the so-called Parisian Bible, a pocket Bible which contains the entire text of the Old and the New Testaments in a relatively small format in two columns in small script. The codex was produced around the middle or in the second half of the 13th century in Central or Eastern France. It is distinguished and made luxurious by no fewer than 82 historiated initials and 66 ornamental initials. Noteworthy is the fact that the biblical text shows signs of careful correction and that the psalms are divided into smaller sections according to a scheme, which rules out that it was commissioned by a monastery, but suggests instead that it was commissioned by a secular priest or a layperson. An erased note of ownership suggests that in 1338 this manuscript belonged to the Celestine Monastery Notre-Dame of Ternes (Limoges), perhaps a gift from its founder Roger le Fort, who was the son of the Lord of Ternes and was Archbishop of Bourges in 1343. Before this Bible became part of the collection of Martin Bodmer, it belonged to the collection of Baron Edmond de Rothschild (1845-1935), hence the name “Rothschild-Bibel.”",

Among the Shiites (from <i>šīʿat ʿAlī</i>, the “party of Ali\"), Ali plays an important religious role as the first imam. This manuscript was written in 1559 by the calligrapher Jalal ibn Muhammad in Bukhara. For the text he used the Nastaliq script, a calligraphic script widely used for the Persian-Arabic alphabet; for the titles, however, he used the ordinary Arabic Nasḫī script. The six full-page miniatures, highlighted in gold, were added in the second/third quarter of the 17th century. Noteworthy on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0501/9v\">p. 9v</a> at bottom center is the rare depiction of a figure turning his back to the observer, of whom one can see only the back of the head.

This revival of the work by Quintus Curtius Rufus, which is augmented by texts from Plutarch, Valerius Maximus, Aulus Gellius and Justin, allows the author to liberate the Macedonian conqueror from legends perpetuated by the medieval tradition. The <i>Miroir des princes</i> portrays a model of a hero shaped within the framework of the humanistic movement initiated by the dukes of Burgundy in the late middle ages. CB 53 was copied in Burgundy and may be fairly accurately dated only a few years after the translation was made; it was decorated with miniatures in the artistic circle of the Master of Marguerite of York (ca. 1470-1475).",

            "Summary (English)" : "The book belongs to the category of <i>nara ehon</i>, a type of polychrome, illustrated narratives published from the Muromachi period though to the first half of the Edo period. The term <i>nara ehon</i> has been widely applied to all illustrated books from these periods since the Meiji era, but its origin is unclear. The format of <i>nara ehon</i> differs, depending on the period. Early examples from the Momoyama to the very early Edo period are tall, measuring about 30 cm in height, a vertical format similar to a European quarto. The examples produced from the Kanei era onwards, within the first half of the Edo period were more of a horizontal proportion.

            "Summary (English)" : "The book belongs to the category of <i>nara ehon</i>, a type of polychrome, illustrated narratives published from the Muromachi period though to the first half of the Edo period. The term <i>nara ehon</i> has been widely applied to all illustrated books from these periods since the Meiji era, but its origin is unclear. The format of <i>nara ehon</i> differs, depending on the period. Early examples from the Momoyama to the very early Edo period are tall, measuring about 30 cm in height, a vertical format similar to a European quarto. The examples produced from the Kanei era onwards, within the first half of the Edo period were more of a horizontal proportion. They were also generally based on the genre of <i>otogizōshi</i>, short stories that emerged from the Kamakura period onwards, a majority of them focusing on the Muromachi period. During the latter half of the 17th century, the topic shifted to stories about the aristocracy or the wealthy merchant class, before the popularity <i>nara ehon</i> began to decline.

It is also known by the title \"Zaigo chūjō nikki\", or \"Diaries of the Prince Ariwara no Narihira\". The main character in the Tale of Ise is understood as being the historical prince and poet Ariwara no Narihira (9th century), whose <i>waka</i> feature in the tale. Yet due to the existence of narratives that clearly date to later periods, Narihira himself cannot be regarded as the author. The tale is generally concerned with human affection of many kinds, from amorous affairs to parental affection. Whilst many chapters do have a strong aristocratic notion, it is not limited to the world of nobility, but also includes the commoner’s fate, such as Chapter 23 Tsutsuizutsu. The characters often remain unnamed and are only referred to as ‘the girl’, or ‘the man’. Thus, the tale is interpretable as an effort to generally address the topic of human relationship and affection.

The complete version of the sutra encompasses six-hundred chapters. It was introduced to China from India by the monk, scholar and translator Xuanzang, who translated the sutra into Chinese in the 7th century before it was imported into Japan. The sutra is written in black ink on high-quality paper, very likely <i>kōzo-shi</i>, which is made using the fibre of Broussonetia papyrifera or paper mulberry tree, especially treasured and used for important documents during the early periods of Japanese history such as the Nara and Heian periods. There is a circular red seal placed over the top of the first four lines of the text, stating “Yakushi-ji-in” (seal of the temple Yakushi-ji). The sutra was written in Japan within the context of the religious rites of reproducing holy scripture to benefit the karma.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Carolingian reform efforts responded to a desire to regularize religious orders by creating a unified rule for monastic life, the <i>Concordia regularum</i> of Benedict of Aniane. In the resulting course of events, an effort was made during the turn from the 9th to the 10th century to dinstinguish the monastic status from the canonical. In 816 Ludwig the Pious made the results of the Council of Aix public; the first part of the <i>Institutio canonicorum</i> presents the statutes of the church fathers and the previous councils, the second part explains the resolutions of the council. The task of putting this work into writing was long attributed to Amalarius of Metz, a student of Alcuin and advisor of Charlemagne; however, another author must be acknowledged for this work, which totals 118 chapters, some of which are extremely comprehensive: Benedict of Aniane is also supposed to have been a contributor. The manuscript held by the Fondation Martin Bodmer was copied only a few years after the original publication of the text (in the first half of the 9th century) in a very fine Carolingian script, and it belonged to the Benedictine Abbey of St. Jacob in Mainz. A full-page drawing portraying the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0068/154v\">crucifixion</a> was added in the 12th or 13th century at the end of the book.",

It is one of the most \r\ncopied texts in the Hindu tradition and survives in a huge number of \r\nmanuscripts. Painted portraits of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna alternate in opening \r\nits 18 chapters.

The second part of the colophon (partially missing), however, links the history of the manuscript to Vrindavan.",

            "Summary (English)" : "<i>Testeriano</i> denotes catechism manuscripts in a pictographic script attributed to the Franciscan friar and missionary Jacobo de Testera (16th century). Writing had already developed in 12th century Central America as a mixture of ideograms, pictograms and phonetic symbols, but the original handwritten witnesses thereof were destroyed in the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century. In order to communicate with the indigenous population, Christian missionaries later adopted this writing system, but they invented many symbols since the goal was to communicate a new, Christian content. For instance, three crowned heads represent the Trinity and thus God, while two crowned heads with key and sword represent the apostles Peter and Paul. The manuscript is read from left to right across both pages; different parts are separated by decorative vertical vignettes. The manuscript contains several short prayers (among them <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/1v\">pp. 1v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/2r\">2r</a> <i>Persignum</i>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/2v\">2v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/4r\">4r</a> <i>Ave Maria</i>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/4v\">4v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/8r\">8r</a> <i>Credo</i>) and a long prayer (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/27v\">27v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/cb-0905/35r\">35r</a>) which represents a repetition of the  Christian doctrine.",

Relying heavily on the--often unreliable--etymologies of the words, Isidore collected in his work the whole of ancient knowledge, in order to prevent it from being forgotten. This manuscript was produced about the end of the 13th century, possibly in the area of the University at Paris and is a witness to the enormous success of this extensive encyclopedia. ",

At the earliest it was written by Flaubert during his voyage to the Orient (1849-1851) with his friend Maxime du Camp, although it seems more likely to date from his return to France in 1851, the moment he dedicated his life to writing. Later know by the title <i>Le Chant de la Courtisane</i>, this prose poem in a humorous tone was not published by Flaubert himself. Nonetheless, it sums up his challenges as a writer: the work shows the author’s fascination with Oriental culture and landscape, which he hopes to to reproduce in a realistic manner. A journal of his voyage, which records his observations and sensations and directly feeds his fictional work. The vocabulary reveals a certain erudition and a concern for accuracy, procedures which herald <i>Salammbô</i>. This manuscript, from the collection of Paul Voute (who had published a facsimile thereof in 1928), was purchased by Martin Bodmer at the Blaizot bookstore.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Mentioned in his correspondence by Flaubert as an explanatory chapter to <i>Salammbô</i>, this manuscript consists of 28 leaves, which are all numbered, except for the last one that contains notes regarding the gods. The manuscript is in a folder on which Flaubert noted the work’s title as well as a date, 1857, that corresponds with the beginning of the writing of <i>Salammbô</i>. This chapter, however, was written after 1857: it was actually conceived after an important documentation phase indispensable to the project and after a trip to Carthage. Upon his return in 1858, the writer worked on a chapter that would be “the topographical and picturesque description of the aforementioned city, with a portrayal of the people who inhabited it, including the traditional costume, government, religion, finances and commerce, etc.\" (Letter to J. Duplan, dated 1 July 1858). Despite a certain number of corrections and marginal additions,  this is the completed version of the text, which ultimately was removed from the novel, even though information therefrom was scattered throughout the work. This chapter reveals the way the author works. He is distinguished by his encyclopedic erudition and his attention to detail, which shed light on the original challenges in the creation of <i>Salammbô</i>: that of reconstructing the then-lost city of Carthage. In November 1949, Martin Bodmer purchased this manuscript at the Blaizot bookstore.",

It is the oldest handwritten version of the <i>Kinder- und Hausmärchen</i> since the Brothers Grimm systematically destroyed all the preliminary work for their edition of the fairy tales, probably in order to prevent the comparison between the handwritten versions and the later printed edition (first edition 1812), which was thoroughly revised and expressed in literary form. According to an analysis by Heinz Rölleke (Rölleke Heinz (ed.), Die älteste Märchensammlung der Brüder Grimm. Synopse der handschriftlichen Urfassung von 1810 und der Erstdrucke von 1812, Cologny-Genève 1975), 25 fairy tales were written by Jacob Grimm, 14 by Wilhelm Grimm (partly with addenda by his brother), and 7 can be attributed to four other authors. Martin Bodmer purchased this manuscript from Mary A. Benjamin, New York, in 1953.",

Hugo movingly denounces the condition of prostitutes: he actually invites the reader to sympathize with rather than despise the “fallen women”. This symbolic vocabulary, usually denoting moral depravity, is used here not to convey a fault, but to express the courage of women who long struggled against the inevitability of the burden of misery before succumbing to it. Far from a moralizing Manicheism, Hugo assigns faults generally attributed to these women also to “à toi, riche ! à ton or”, pointing a finger at the injustice of a social system lacking any distribution of wealth as well as “à nous”, each citizen whose regard is not charitable enough. This manuscript presents a slight variation of the printed text since it reads: “s’y retenir longtemps de leurs mains épuisées” instead of “s’y cramponner longtemps”.",

Hugo himself crossed out the original title „Impératrice“ for being too obvious. The text is addressed to the wife of Napoleon III, Eugenia de Montijo, whom Hugo reproaches for her „bigoterie“ (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/ms-Hugo-H-071-003/3r\">3r</a>) and her „signe de croix grotesque à l’espagnole“ (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/ms-Hugo-H-071-003/1r\">1r</a>). Thus he extends to the spouse the criticism of Napoleon III that he had already presented in the <i>Châtiments</i>. The date of October 11, 1869, in Hugo’s own handwriting, suggests that the text was created in Brussels, where Hugo lived in exile since the coup of December 2, 1851.",

Several themes are interwoven in this poem, which contrasts the probity of a woman praying in the middle of an abandoned church with the city’s hedonists, nihilists hurling themselves \"d'ivresses en ivresses”. Hugo surprises this pure soul in the midst of adversity, invoking the help of the Lord to save her from overwhelming sadness. In this last part (VI), the writer increases his Christian support (<i>Votre âme qui bientôt fuira peut-être ailleurs / Vers les régions pures, / Et vous emportera plus loin que nos douleurs, Plus loin que nos murmures !</i>) with an angelic and serene quatrain: <i>Soyez comme l'oiseau, posé pour un instant / Sur des rameaux trop frêles, / Qui sent ployer la branche et qui chante pourtant, / Sachant qu'il a des ailes !</i>",

            "Summary (English)" : "With his six novels and his famous collections of over 300 short stories, Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893) has earned a place among the most important French writers of the end of the 19th century. He presented an often unvarnished picture of provincial as well as Parisian society of his time. This is the case in the present story, the only one to have had a separate original edition preceding its publication in the collection of the same name. This manuscript was used for the first printing of the text, which was originally published on June 15, 1887 in <i>La Nouvelle Revue</i>. It contains numerous corrections and deletions (which bear witness to the creation of the story), as well as slight variations in comparison with the version published in the volume of March 28, 1888.",

Although the painter often was very sparing in his use of paper, for these few lines he used a large and beautiful in-folio sheet, folded and glued together (to add more thickness). Writing in a humanist script close to calligraphy, he showed particular care for the layout, using line spacing and indentations to reinforce the customary architecture of the <i>sonetto</i>. His tone is very respectful: Michelangelo greets not only a friend, but also a lady who is part of high society and who has given him a valuable gift. This gift, which was to take its beneficiary \"<i>in paradiso</i>”, must have been a manuscript of the <i>Sonetti spirituali</i> of the poet (who in general was very discreet and only rarely showed her verses).",

In Malherbe’s opinion, there is no cause for concern: the King of England is no more than a second-rate monarch, militarily not on a par with France and not able to support the Huguenots of La Rochelle. As to the threat posed by the Reformed, Malherbe judges them to be near the end: \"<i>la Huguenoterie court fortune par toute l’Europe d’estre voisine de sa fin</i>.\"",

On <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fmb/ms-Napoleon-N-004-001/2r\">page 3</a>, tired of his subject, the emperor covers the page with strategic and military calculations, having frigates engage with regiments and artillery.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This autograph by Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891) contains a fragment of a poem. Written on the recto side of a page are three sections numbered with Roman numerals from II to IV\r\nand, with the exception of the last one (IV), titled. Although the text is\r\nwritten in prose, the designation “sonnet” (II) could be due to the form of the\r\nexcerpt in question, which is presented in 14 lines. The first section contains\r\nthe sign +, which is difficult to interpret and which gives the impression that\r\nRimbaud had planned to rework it. The numbering suggests that these three\r\nsections form a homogeneous whole together with the section <i>Dimanche</i> (I, BNF manuscript), thus constituting the poem <i>Jeunesse</i>. One can see inscriptions by other hands from after 1886: the annotation <i>Illuminations</i> in the upper left corner deliberately refers to the collection of poems with that same title, which was originally published in 1886. The poem <i>Jeunesse</i>, which consists of four stanzas, was first published by Vanier in 1895, after the <i>Poésies complètes</i>, as a complement to the <i>Illuminations</i>.",

Letter VII, where this page comes from, supports the right of representation when it comes to correcting abuses of the Small Council, and it recommends that citizens convened in the General Council reject all new elections of magistrates if these should insist upon overstepping the rights given them by the Constitution. The <i>Lettres</i> were censored in Geneva as well as in Paris. This document is from the collection of Ch. Vellay (purchased by Martin Bodmer in 1926) and contains a draft of two passages from the <i>Lettres</i>. The first of these was published in the original edition (Amsterdam, M. M. Rey, 1764), the second in the edition of the <i>Œuvres complètes</i> of the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade.",

            "Summary (English)" : "The <i>Mémoire présenté à M. de Mably sur l’éducation de M. son fils</i> is Rousseau’s first writing related to his experience as an educator. In 1740 he took up a difficult position as tutor in the family of the notable Jean Bonnot de Mably, provost general of police in the Lyon region. This position came to an end after only one year. Two young children with little inclination to study had been entrusted to his care: François-Paul-Marie Bonnot de Mably, called Monsieur de Sainte-Marie, five and a half years old, and Jean-Antoine Bonnot de Mably, called Monsieur de Condillac, four and a half years old. The long <i>Mémoire</i>, dedicated to the older boy, emphasizes the “educational mission” and experience with practical education: it is presented as a plan and a synthesis; its writing has been dated around December 1740. The young tutor addresses M. de Mably and makes known to him the plan and structure for the education of his son in order to shape “the heart, the judgment and the spirit.” This is not the natural education, which later on will be advocated in ’<i>Émile</i>. Did Rousseau really present this <i>Mémoire</i> to M. de Mably? Known is only that he gave this manuscript of the <i>Mémoire</i> to Mme Dupin, his employer in 1743, and that since then it has been kept with the “Papers of Mme Dupin.” It was published for the first time in Paris in 1884 by G. de Villeneuve-Guibert in <i>Le portefeuille de Madame Dupin</i>. The Fondation Bodmer’s manuscript is the only one in existence. A <i>Projet d’éducation</i>, much shorter, more clearly structured and of unknown date, was found among Rousseau’s papers at the time of his death (this manuscript, now lost, was first published in Geneva in 1782). It is very similar to the <i>Mémoire</i> and seems to have been written",

The poet had submitted his original work to various humanists and high-ranking scholars, and he took into consideration certain critiques and suggestions when editing his verses during the summer of 1576. Several stanzas were profoundly revised or even completely rewritten. Stanza 42 was one of the most reworked, to the point that Tasso had to paste this small strip of paper with the definitive version of the text into the manuscript. The text describes the attitude and thoughts of the Muslim princess Armide, who gets ready to harangue the caliph and his armies and incite them to fight to the death with the crusaders and thus to take revenge on the Christian hero Rinaldo, who had abandoned her.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Felix Lope de Vega y Carpio (1562-1635), author of many <i>comedias de santos</i>, finished this <i>Historia de Barlán y Josafat, comedia</i> in three acts and in verse at home „<i>En Madrid a primero de febrero de 1611</i>.“ This complete manuscript contains numerous corrections and revisions by the author. This story of a conversion is more than an authentic Christian legend (then attributed to Saint John of Damascus) — it is above all a Christianized story. In the prince, who first gives up his palace in order to learn about the plagues of the world and then leaves his throne for the meditative life of an ascetic, one certainly recognizes Buddha. The edifying Christian story, set at the banks of the Ganges, is nothing other than an adaptation of <i>Vie du Bodhisattva</i>, a 2nd-4th century Sanskrit text, which over centuries was translated and adapted first by the Manichaeans, then by the Arabs, Georgians and Byzantines, until it finally reached the far distant people of the Western World: Lope de Vega’s work thus (without the author’s having been aware of this) is part of one of the  most impressive chains of intellectual transmission in history.",

Although the text is not complete, it contains a passage about the saint’s martyrdom, which is not included in the text’s principal manuscript held at the Zentralbibliothek of Zurich (Ms. Rh. 5). The community of Dalpe probably obtained this <i>Passio</i> so they could celebrate a yearly mass in honor of the saint in the new village chapel. The chapel had originally been dedicated to the Mary, but, as attested by documented sources, the patronage changed between 1370 and 1426, and the chapel was dedicated to St. Placidus.",

At the end of the text, there are blank pages onto which were copied letters of exemption for the people of theVal Mesolcina (a valley in the Swiss Canton of Grisons), which were issued in the years 1498-1499. The manuscript belonged to the Varone family; in 1537 it was bought and restored by the Bellinzona notary Giovanni Giacomo Rusca. In the 17th century, Carlo Bernardino Zacconi donated the manuscript to the library of the Jesuits of Bellinzona, which was later taken over by the Benedictines, and around 1787 the manuscript came to the Abbey Library of Einsiedeln.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript was produced in the Convent of Dominican Sisters of St. Verena in Zurich in 1449. In addition to the life of Benedict following Gregory’s <i>Dialogi</i>, in a unique translation that seems to exist only in this codex (according to Werner Williams-Krapp), the manuscript contains translations of three more legends of 13th century Dominican saints. These as well are attested only in this codex, have practically never been studied, and have not even been edited. First there is one of three versions of the translation of the <i>Vita S. Dominici</i> by Dietrich of Apolda; then there is the translation of Thomas Agno de Lentino's <i>Legenda maior</i> about the Inquisitor Peter of Milan (also know as Peter Martyr or Peter of Verona), who was killed in 1252; attached to this is the bull of his canonization issued by Pope Innocent IV in 1253. It is noteworthy that the translation of the bull also contains a legend of Peter which, according to Regina D. Schiewer, is independent of the one by Thomas Agno. If the translations of these legends into Alemannic that are contained in Cod. 671 were in fact created around 1300, as assumed by Schwierer, then the (abbreviated?) version of the translation of the life of Dominic contained in Cod. 671 would constitute the earliest proof of the presence of the revelations of Mechthild of Magdeburg in Southwestern Germany, as the final chapter of the fifth book of the life of Dominic (cf. fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/sbe/0671/80v\">80v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/sbe/0671/82r\">82r</a>) is based on excerpts from the Latin translation of <i>Das Fließende Licht der Gottheit</i>.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Engelberg 52 is a late eleventh-century handbook of canon law from the circle of Bernold of Constance († 1100), an ardent champion of Pope Gregory VII. It comprises various canonistic compilations: the 'Collection in Seventy-Four Titles' (<i>Collectio 74 titulorum</i> with the so-called 'Swabian Appendix' (<i>Appendix svevica</i>; two short collections 'On Churches' (<i>De ecclesiis</i>) and 'On Illicit Unions' (<i>De illicitis coniunctionibus</i>); the Pseudo-Gelasian decretal 'On Books to be Received and not to be Received' (<i>De libris recipiendis et non recipiendis</i>); the 'Canons of the Four Principal Councils' prefaced by 'Adnotation I' (<i>Adnotatio I</i>; and the <i>Epitome Hadriani</i> prefaced by 'Adnotation II' (<i>Adnotatio II</i>). All of these items can also be found in two closely related manuscripts (St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0676\">Cod.

Prefixed to the whole is a catalogue of popes extending from Peter I to Leo IX with the addition of Victor II. Though it acknowledges Henry III’s role in the appointment of four popes (from Clement II to Victor II), it was possibly the source of the papal catalogue that Bernold attached to his Chronicle (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm 432, fols. <a href=\"http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00039847/image_27\">10r</a>–<a href=\"http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00039847/image_31\">12r</a>).",

Each prophet is colorfully depicted in a historiated initial at the beginning of his book. The name of the prophet under discussion appears in red ink in the top margin of every other two-page spread. Small, colourful decorated initials sometimes introduce new paragraphs in the prologues. Except for the prologues, the pages are laid out in three columns: the middle column contains the biblical text, the left and right columns provide, in a smaller script, the exposition. A two-line verse dedication on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bke/0076/1r\">1r</a> ascribes the codex to the library of Abbot Frowin of Engelberg (1143-1178). ",

He got his name from a breviary in two volumes that was created around 1493 for the Bishop of Sion, Jost of Silenen (1482-1496).\nAfter the introduction of the Reformation to Bern in the year 1528 and the subsequent secularization of the chapter, the entire group of antiphonaries was sold in 1530: four were sold to the city of Estavayer-le-Lac and were used there for the liturgy of the Collegiate Church of St. Lorenz; the other two — among them a duplicate of this manuscript — reached Vevey under circumstances that remain unexplained.

It contains the summer portion of the <i>De Tempore</i> according to the liturgy of the Diocese of Lausanne. Its duplicate is contained in <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/psle/0003a\">volume III</a>.\nThe book decoration is by an anonymous artist; it consists of cadels, fleuronée initials and an illuminated initial with a border on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/psle/0003b/1r\">f. 1r</a>. After the introduction of the Reformation to Bern in the year 1528 and the subsequent secularization of the chapter, the entire group of six antiphonaries was sold in 1530. Four were sold to the city of Estavayer-le-Lac and were used there for the liturgy of the Collegiate Church of St. Lorenz; the other two reached Vevey under circumstances that remain unexplained; they are currently held in the historical museum there.",

Calendar with the signs of the zodiac and with agricultural tasks to be carried out in each month. Particularly worthy of emphasis are the full-page representations of St. Christopher (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/176\">p. 176</a>), of the Adoration of the Magi (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/178\">p. 178</a>), and of Christ on the Cross (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/179\">p. 179</a>). Based on the mention of saints in the calendar and in the rest of the manuscript, it was probably created in Besançon. From there, by unexplained means, it came into the possession of the patrician family Wallier of Solothurn: owners’ entries by Guillaume Wallier (16th century) and Henri Wallier (1605) on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/4\">p. 4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kbt/y024/731\">p. 731</a>, the latter’s also on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/binding/kbt/y024/bindingE/\">front cover</a>. On p. 90 of the 1858 catalogue of the cantonal library of Thurgau, the provenance is given as Fischingen. Possibly the mansucript reached Fischingen by means of one of the two abbots of Fischingen from Solothurn, Augustin Bloch from Oberbuchsitten (1776-1815) or the last Abbot of Fischingen, Franz Fröhlicher from Bellach (1836- 1848).",

Regarding the content, the manuscript consists of two parts: the history of the monastery and a list of ecclesial events. The former begins with Abbot Girard (1138-1157) and ends with Abbot Petrus (end of the 16th century); the latter pertains to the years between 1500 and 1510.",

These objects themselves disappeared without a trace in 1822, with the exception of three ceremonial robs of the Order of the Golden Fleece (which are now on display in the castle of Gruyère). The book contains 42 illustrations: 3 frontispieces show the coats of arms of the city, its bailiwicks, and the coats of arms of the members of the Executive Council; 30 illustrations reproduce the banners and 9 illustrations portray Burgundian clothing items and tapestries. The “Book of Flags” is an art object, valuable as a record of objects that have been lost, as well as a witness to the fame of the Fribourg troops in the late Middle Ages.",

            "Summary (English)" : "The “Katharinenbuch” contains the regulations for a secondary school, as it was to be founded in Fribourg at the time of the Catholic reform on the model of the reformed schools. Peter Schneuwly (1540-1597) can be considered the author; he himself probably went to school in Fribourg. From 1557 on, he studied in Freiburg im Breisgau, where he attained a <i>Magister artium</i>. From 1564 on, he was a member of the clergy of the Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas in Fribourg, in 1565 he became a canon, and in 1566 a preacher in the city. At this time, the first preparatory works for the “Katharinenbuch” took shape. In the years 1577-1597, Schneuwly was vicar general of the Diocese of Lausanne, from 1578-1587 also provost of St. Nicholas. The “Katharinenbuch” also constitutes the charter of the “Scholarchenkammer” (chamber of scholarchs) of the city of Fribourg, in whose possession it remained until the 19th century. The school reform sought by Schneuwly never went into effect because in 1580, also on Schneuwly’s initiative, the Jesuits were called to Fribourg and were entrusted with secondary education.",

The original and oldest part of the necrology is by the same scribe as the rest of the manuscript, which can be dated to 1338 by means of the colophon at the end of the Rule of St. Augustine (fol. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/aef/MH-Nekrolog/81r/0/Sequence-2562\">81r</a>): \"<i>Hic liber est abbacie Humilismontis Premonstratensis ordinis Lausannensis dyocesis scriptus in eadem abbatia anno Domini Mo CCCo XXXVIIIo mense iulio</i>”. The necrology was later completed by various hands that registered donations for annual Masses for the deceased (for members of the abbey as well as for laypeople).

The manuscript was written in Erfurt in the summer of 1486 and has as its topic the refutation of three errors. The first regards those who claim “to be able to calculate and foresee the Last Judgment.” It seems that this document is the only handwritten version of this text, which is known through two printed editions from the 15th century. Franz Xaver Karker (1812-1892), Canon of the Cathedral of Breslau (today Wroclaw in Poland), donated this work to the Fribourg library.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Probably written around 1200 in Hauterive, this Cistercian missal has recently attracted the attention of historians who study St. Elizabeth of Hungary (1207-1231). Together with another manuscript from Hauterive, the antiphonary L 301, this manuscript is considered evidence of the rapid spread of the cult of the saint in a Cistercian monastery. Indeed, the general chapter of the Cistercians decided in 1236 to have the name of the saint, who was canonized the previous year, entered into the martyrology and into the calendar of the order. The corresponding entry in our manuscript’s calendar, by a second hand, is probably a consequence of this decision.",

One could reasonably propose that it originated at Hauterive. Without doubt, the text at the beginning of the collection was most important for the monks, a <i>Vita</i> of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (the <i>Vita prima</i>), which takes up the greatest part of the manuscript. Also worth noting is a text quite surprising in a monastic context: the <i>Liber locorum sanctorum terrae Jerusalem</i> at the time of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem by Fretellus of Nazareth († after 1154). Another particularity of the manuscript is its binding with flaps that show traces of metalwork in the shape of a star.",

Henry, whose biography is still a subject of debate, chose the learned title <i>Pentaconthamonadius</i> (“the fifty-first”) to designate a sermonary composed of 17 groups of three sermons intended for the liturgy of the White monks. Amadeus of Clermont, a Cistercian monk who became bishop of Lausanne (1145-1159), is the author of eight homilies in honor of the Mother of God, which achieved lasting success as liturgical texts because used in the breviary of the diocese of Lausanne.

In this form, the missal could have served the celebrant for both the conventual mass and for the private mass that Cistercians are known to have held since their origins. The geographical origin of the codex has not been determined with certainty. Without doubt, however, from the fifteenth century onward it was at Hauterive, where it was re-bound. The rich decoration in the canon section provide a fine example of fleuronné initials from the end of the thirteenth century; here, the decoration of the scrolls seems to be still “domesticated” by rigorous framing.” (Joseph Leisibach, <i>Liturgica Friburgensia. Des Livres pour Dieu</i>, 1993, p. 89).",

The colophon, which states these details, also names the recipient of the manuscript, Jacques Trompettaz († 1503), a compatriot of the copyist. The latter was careful to include in several passages of the text, in addition to his own name and that of the addressee, the names of two more Fribourg friends, Claude de Gruyère and Jacques Sutz, Monk at Hauterive.

            "Summary (English)" : "The liturgical content of this manuscript corresponds to that in use among the Carthusians. The church consecration festival listed in the <i>Proprium de Sanctis</i> between the feast days on the 4th and the 23rd of April probably refers to the 18th of April, when this holiday was celebrated at La Lance. This observation suggests that the manuscript was created in the Carthusian Monastery La Lance (Canton of Vaud). Several ex-libris can be dated around 1500 and confirm the presence of this codex in the monastery, at least until its dissolution in 1538. Then the manuscript was passed on to the Carthusian Monastery Part-Dieu in the Canton of Fribourg. Recently the manuscript was restored and the old binding was replaced.",

The presence of certain texts indicates a Cistercian origin (<i>Vita</i> of St. Robert of Molesme, the author Geoffroy de Hautecombe) and, based on our knowledge of medieval Hauterive, a regional origin (the <i>Vita</i> of St. Theodore, Bishop of Sion; the <i>Vita</i> and the <i>Miracula</i> of Saint Nicholas of Myra; the <i>Vita</i> of St. Elizabeth of Hungary; the <i>Passio</i> of Saint Maurice and his companions by Eucherius of Lyon). The end of the book contains a collection of texts related to confession. The last one of these attests a little know activity of the monks: the pastoral care of the Cistercian nuns. The manuscript remains in its original cover which, although damaged, is still well recognizable: a cover with wide flaps that cover the edges of the book.",

The second textual unit was written in 1455 by the scribe Franciscus de Gallandia from Yvonand. It goes by the title <i>Fabulae moralizatate</i> and consists of 122 Latin fables taken from various sources from antiquity, presented in the form of dialogs. Magninus Mediolanensis (d. 1376) and Nicolaus Pergamenus are identified as the authors. Beginning with the first print edition (1480) the <i>Fabulae moralizatae</i> were re-named <i>Dialogus creaturarum optime moralizatus</i>.",

One of the scribes, who was also the owner and redactor of the volume, was Fredrich von Amberg (about 1350/60-1432), who lived from 1393-1432 in the Franciscan cloister in Fribourg and served two terms as guardian there. Friedrich was able to assemble these copies of the texts by either copying or purchasing them while studying in Strassburg, Paris, and Avignon. ",

Around the end of the 14th century, Friedrich von Amberg (ca. 1350-1432) obtained a not particularly carefully written copy from the German group, which provides the older redaction of Marsilius. Amberg corrected this version of the text, written on paper from the Middle German area with watermarks from the last decade of the 14th century, added marginal glosses and then had it bound.",

The same hand is responsible for the major illuminations at the beginning of the various sections as well the initials in the text. The flourished initials are of great elegance. A partly erased <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/cl0054/13r\">coat</a> of arms on the opening leaf indicates that the book of hours was made for the wedding of a male member of the Serristori family.

It is presented in the form of biblical stories and combines the <i>Vulgata</i> of Jerome with the <i>Historia Scholastica</i> of Peter Comestor. It was quickly supplemented with the second volume of the <i>Bible du XIIIe siècle</i> (“Thirteenth-century Bible”). Because it was widely disseminated during the 14th and 15th centuries, today there are 144 known examples, both complete exemplars and fragments.",

Salmon presents the qualities a sovereign needs in order to rule well.

This work of knightly character is strongly influenced by the <i>Lancelot en prose</i>, which was written at the end of the first quarter of the 13th century. In this collection, which refer to the myths of Tristan and Arthur, Tristan is portrayed as the perfect lover and as the perfect knight, who as a Knight of the Round Table participates in the search for the Holy Grail. The Geneva manuscript is incomplete. It ends with the jousting competition between King Arthur and Tristan, in which the latter unseats the King and Yvain from their saddles. The defeated pair then returns to Roche Dure (Volume 3 of the Philippe Menard edition, 1991). At this time there are 82 known manuscripts and manuscript fragments of this work.",

The translation, completed in 1468, presents Alexander as conqueror, devoid of all legends transmitted through courtly literature; it is dedicated to Charles the Bold, the son of Isabella. This copy from the Bibliothèque de Genève was illustrated by a Flemish artist, Maître d’Edouard IV, who was active in Bruges around the end of the 15th century, as well as by a second hand not yet definitively identified.",

            "Summary (English)" : "One of the ancient authors best known in the\r\nMiddle Ages doubtlessly was Cicero. Some of his speeches - the <i>Orationes</i> - were rediscovered by humanists, as is attested by\r\nthis copy. The manuscript contains 27 of Cicero’s speeches, written in a round\r\nItalian humanistic script. It begins with a miniature depicting a group of\r\nspeakers in a discussion (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0101/1r/0/Sequence-2574\">1r</a>), painted by Péronet Lamy, an illuminator who is documented\r\nfrom 1432 until 1453 and who worked primarily for Amadeus VIII, the Duke of\r\nSavoy. It is likely that Péronet Lamy carried out this decoration when he was at\r\nthe Council of Basel as part of the Duke’s entourage. Also present there was\r\nMartin le Franc (1408-1461), ducal secretary and author of the <i>Champion des Dames</i> and the\r\n<i>Estrif de fortune et de vertu</i>; according to a scraped entry (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0101/290r/0/Sequence-2574\">290r</a>), he came into\r\npossession of this manuscript. Thereafter it belonged to Germain Colladon (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0101/bindingF/0/Sequence-2574\">back pastedown</a>), a fellow student of John Calvin, who\r\nfled to Geneva in 1550. Around 1615, one of his daughters-in-law sold the\r\nmanuscript, together with Ms. lat. 53, to the Bibliothèque de Genève.",

According to François Huot, the various parts could have existed separately, but they seem to have been combined since the beginning of the 13th century. Primarily in the 13th and 14th century, diverse texts were added on previously blank pages, among them list of dues owed the abbey noted on pages <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0157/75v\">f. 75v</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0157/99r\">99r</a>.

Some of the 14 miniatures that decorate the manuscript can in fact also be found in other books of hours that were illuminated by the master of Bourges, such as the cord situated in the ornate margins that frame the miniatures  (Paris, BnF, n.a. lat. 3181). This motif has been interpreted in different ways, either as a sign of belonging to the Third Order of Franciscans, or as a sign of widowhood, in which case the addressee would have been a woman – but this is contradicted by the masculine forms of address in the prayers. The manuscript later became the property of Paul Petau, and in 1756 it became part of the collection of the  Bibliothèque de Genève as part of the bequest of Ami Lullin.",

It is a distinctive testimony to the masterly page layout of legal texts, where the main text is usually framed on all sides by its commentary.

The manuscript also is sumptuously decorated with large miniatures that introduce the main parts of the text as well as the various legal cases; in addition, there are numerous historiated initials, often very humorous (e.g. f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0060/2r/0/Sequence-1555\">2r</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bge/lat0060/127v/0/Sequence-1555\">127v</a>), and figure initials. Two book illustrators from Bologna, the Master of 1346 and l'Illustratore, are the creators of this decoration that was carried out in the 1340s. In 1756, the <i>Decretum Gratiani</i> became part of the Bibliothèque de Genève with the bequest of Ami Lullin, who had purchased this copy from the collection of Paul and Alexander Petau.",

Along with Palermo, Archivio di Stato \"Codice Basile\" and Rome, Biblioteca Vaticana Ottob. lat. 1346, and together with <a href=\"http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:16-diglit-45269\">Pal. lat. 920</a>, this remnant of a leaf is among the oldest text witnesses of the <i>Getica</i>.

The value of this unique and extraordinary work lies in the quality of its textual illustrations: 337 scenes of great artistic refinement, very lively and expressive. The illustrations consist of historiated initials, ornamental initials, drolleries and marginal illustrations. The text, which is written in extremely carefully formed calligraphy on very fine parchment, is St. Jerome's Vulgate version of the Bible in Latin, revised in Paris in the second quarter of the 13th century. This document is one of the few remaining works from this particular school of book decoration in northern France.",

The appearance of the name of St. Clara in the text suggests that the codex was written in a cloister of the Poor Clares, perhaps the Paradise. It came into the posession of the Capuchin cloister in Frauenfeld at the beginning of the 17th century and has been held in the provincial archive of the Capuchins in Lucerne since 1848.",

Through the rituals for conjuring spirits described in the book, people around the priest Hans Kaspar Giger hoped to become wealthy. The volume was labeled “superstitious” by the authorities, was sealed and placed in the archives.",

Bonaventura), profane (Cicero, Sallust), historical (Piccolomini/Pius II.) and rhetorical (Laurentius de Aquileja) texts. The second part of the volume, containing the <i>Rhetorica </i>, was written in 1465/66 by the Augustinian Matthias Glaser from Breisach in Basel.

            "Summary (English)" : "This work by brother Alonso de Oropesa OSH († 1469) must be considered in the context of the attacks on converted Jews in Spain (and above all in Toledo), the so-called conversos.  As a general of the Order of the Hieronymites (since 1457), but also as a close confidant and adviser of King Henry IV of Castile (1454-1474), Alonso advocated a tolerant attitude towards converted Jews. In 1450, he began writing the <i>'Lumen ad revelationem gentium et gloria plebis Dei Israel' - De unitate fidei et de concordia et pacifica equalitate fidelium</i> (f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/1r\">1</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/203v\">203</a>, Tabula <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/204r\">204</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bs/Ms-J0011/207r\">207</a>); in 1465, he dedicated the completed book of 52 chapters to the Archbishop Alfonso Carrillo of Toledo (1410-1485). The announced second part of the work apparently was never written.In 1979, Luis A. Diaz y Diaz prepared a Spanish translation based on the three manuscripts then known. The present manuscript has not yet been acknowledged in research; it thus constitutes the fourth manuscript known so far. It was certainly written still in the 15th century and is made up of parchment and paper leaves. Despite its significance, no Latin text edition of the work has yet been prepared.",

The event described is said to have occurred in the time of Abbess Adelheid I (1211-1233). According to the account, important to the history of piety, the nun Agnes, daughter of a knight from Sent in the lower Engadine, received the Eucharistic Host one Holy Thursday, with a dubious conscience; she did not eat it however, hiding it instead in her veil and then storing it in her little chest. Thereafter the host transformed into flesh and blood. This is the origin of the pilgrimage to the Holy Blood at Müstair. Appended to the narrative text are regesta of documents concerning the cult of the Holy Blood.",

Two excerpts remain: the first section of text, consisting of parts of chapter 17 (17.16-17.18), is a commentary on Luke 10, 1-9, i.e. the verses concerning the sending out of the seventy-two disciples. The second section of text, containing parts of chapter 18 (18.2-18.3), refers to John 8.46-59. These verses are a commentary on a dispute between Jesus and “the” Jews as well as the high priests; it concerns the identity of Jesus or rather his claim of identity, his message and the rejection thereof.",

Space was left for decorated letters, which were not executed. The text at the end is damaged. The 135 leaves are separated into 19 quires. The first and last leaves are missing. The manuscript probably is from the library of the Counts of Neuchâtel since it is mentioned in an inventory from the library of Jean de Fribourg and Rudolf von Hochberg, which was prepared at the end of the 15th century. In 1813 the governing council gave the manuscript, along with 16 other pieces, to the library of Neuchâtel.",

Starting in 1753, in answer to attacks and criticism brought on by his articles, he begins to revise and rewrite them. Because he strives for lexicographic completeness in the field of music, the author composes more and more new entries, reaching close to nine hundred terms.

The ceremonies are represented as full page miniatures with ornamental initials, marginal decorations and several lines of text on the model of books of hours; in the text there are many colorful borders and ornamental initials, often with depictions of the liturgical objects mentioned in the text. In addition to the frequently recurring coat of arms of Melchior von Lichtenfels, Archbishop of Basel (1554-1575), there is the coat of arms of Charles de Neufchâtel, Archbishop of Besançon (1463-1498; visible on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bcj/0010/1r\">f. 1r</a>), which gives an indication of the manuscript’s date of origin. As many other manuscripts from religious institutions, this manuscript came into the possession of the Jesuit College of Porrentruy during the French Revolution, until in the 20th century it became part of the collection of the Library of the Canton of Jura.",

Several notes of ownership allow us to reconstruct the work’s route. According to a signature dated 1610 (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bcj/A2046/Br/0/Sequence-2241\">Br</a>), it belonged to the Bellelay canon and prior of la Porte-Du-Ciel, Jean Grosjean de Porrentruy († 1617). In the 19th century it was successively owned by Father Grégoire Voirol - <i>Recuperavit ao 1802, G. Voirol, ? </i> - , by P. Migy - <i>ex-libris P. Migy, parochi Bruntruti, 1809</i>, and then by <i>L. Vautrey, par. Delemont</i> (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bcj/A2046/bindingE/0/Sequence-2241\">pastedown</a>).",

            "Summary (English)" : "The\r\nfirst liturgical library of the nuns of Fille-Dieu, which today is dispersed\r\nacross all of Europe, has great significance for the history of the Cistercian\r\nOrder. The booklet FiD 1 (French musical notation) contains the oldest offices of St. Bernard and of the\r\nTrinity, which were introduced into the order in 1175 or shortly thereafter.\r\nThe flyleaves are remarkable as well. Together with <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/fdr/0002\">FiD 2</a>, they represent\r\nrelics of antiphonaries that were copied around 1136/1140 and contain the\r\noriginal Cistercian liturgy, which was copied shortly after 1108 in Metz by\r\nmonks sent by Abbot Stephen Harding. This liturgy was corrected within the\r\nframework of the reforms of Bernard of Clairvaux. The existence of Bernardine\r\ndrafts had until now been known through antiphonary 12A-B from Westmalle Abbey\r\n(Belgium) and through the one from Tamié Abbey 6 (Savoy). Codicological\r\nanalysis of the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fdr/0001/V1r/0/Sequence-2560\">flyleaves of FiD 1</a> and of the fragments of <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/fdr/0002\">FiD 2</a> reveals that\r\nall pieces come from the Swiss Abbey of Fille-Dieu; they share identical status\r\nand common characteristics, irrespective of current holding sites. The same\r\nhands and correcting hands can be recognized, the same types of ornamentation\r\nand the same later touch-ups, which were done at the earliest in the 16th\r\ncentury, probably by the nuns or by the monks of Hautcrêt Abbey (Oron, VD),\r\nwhich was the mother house of Fille-Dieu until 1536.",

Doubtlessly the parchment pieces of various sizes were glued together by the nuns of Fille-Dieu in order to cover a now lost liturgical formulary. Together, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/fdr/0001\">FiD 1</a> and FiD 2 constitute relics of antiphonaries that contained the primitive Cistercian liturgy. This was defined by Fr. Kovacs (“Fragments du chant cistercien primitif“, ASOC 6 [1950], pp. 140–150) and Chr. Waddell (The Primitive Cistercian Breviary, Fribourg, 2007 [Spicilegium Friburgense 44]) as the liturgy reformed by Stephen Harding shortly after 1108. During this reform, the abbot of Cîteaux forced the order to adopt the antiphonary of Metz, which was in use by the order until the time of the second reform under Bernard of Clairvaux. This second reform was completed in the early 1140s. The existence of Bernardine drafts had until now been known through antiphonary 12A-B from Westmalle Abbey (Belgium) and through the one from Tamié Abbey 6 (Savoy). Codicological analysis of the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fdr/0001/V1r/0/Sequence-2560\">flyleaves of FiD 1</a> and of the fragments of FiD 2 reveals that all pieces come from the Swiss Abbey of Fille-Dieu; they share identical status and common characteristics, irrespective of current holding sites.

In addition, f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/fdr/0005/98v/0/Sequence-2575\">98v</a> contains no mention of an octave of St. Bernard, which is usually included in all Cistercian books from 1295 on. A study of the musical and liturgical content shows that manuscript FiD 5, which is a faithful copy of the older Gradual of the order (Abbazia Tre Fontane 47, around 1140/1143), probably originated in Hautcrêt Abbey (Oron VD), which was the motherhouse of Fille-Dieu until 1536.",

Converging indicators, such as the statements by Chiampell (Placidus Plattner, Ulrici Campelli Historia raetica, Basel, Schneider, T. 2 1890, 353), as well as the orthography and the language of the transcriptions suggest that this is the only surviving copy of the Joseph-drama by Chiampell himself, which was performed in Susch in 1564. At the end of the manuscript, there is a conversation between a Protestant pastor and a sick person (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/75r/0/Sequence-2592\">75</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/77v/0/Sequence-2592\">77</a>), as well as several prayers (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/78r/0/Sequence-2592\">78</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/cps/Ad0109/80v/0/Sequence-2592\">80</a>), which were translated from the German by the scribe of the text, Baltasar Valantin.",

Among the notes added in the first half of the 14th century is one attesting to the transfer of the diocese from Windisch to Constance at the time of King Dagobert (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bks/membr0010/29v\">29v</a>). The last page contained notes about the history of Muri Abbey in the 14th and 15th century, which were probably removed in the 19th century.

It is called the “White Book” because it was originally bound in a white pigskin cover. It contains copies of privileges, alliances, and important decisions by the courts of arbitration and the <i>Landesgemeinden</i> beginning in 1316, and was written for the most part in the years 1470/1471. It is the most important cartulary from the Obwalden Chancellery during the late Middle Ages and, as such, is still part of the city archives today. However, this book is famous above all because it contains the oldest version of the story of the founding of the Swiss Confederation on a mere 25 pages (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/staow/A02CHR0003/441\">pp. 441</a>–<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/staow/A02CHR0003/465\">465</a>).

Based on the entries in Latin, German, French and English, it is possible to reconstruct two trips that Fisher took to London, during which most of the dedications occurred: 1747-1750 via Geneva, Lyon, Paris to London and 1758 via Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Amsterdam to London. Several entries are by members of the Schalch family of Schaffhausen, who were relatives of Fischer; among these is an undated watercolor by the artist Johann Jakob Schalch (1723-1789) (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/kgfs/0144-0032/122\">122</a>), who lived in London and Den Haag from 1754-1773.

It was most likely produced in or about 960 in Trier, at St. Maximin or the cathedral scriptorium, as the work of a collective of about twenty (student) hands, among which the expert correcting hand of St. Wolfgang can also be distinguished. The manuscript may have been brought to the monastery of Allerheiligen in Schaffhausen in 1122, by Archbishop Bruno of Trier, a son of cloister founder Eberhard von Nellenburg.",

The beginning of the text (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/de/sbs/min0011/4r\">4r</a>) has been decorated by the same artist with an initial “V”, in the gold tendrils of which four animals (dragon, dog, bird of prey, deer) are artfully entwined.",

It contains commentaries in Latin by the Dominican Albertus Magnus (ca. 1200-1280) on the six foundation texts of medieval instruction in logic. Their wording was altered during the 14th century using a text handed down by a separate tradition, familiar today mainly through Italian Renaissance manuscripts. The resulting hybrid text, with good, though often singular, textual variations, is of particular importance for the edition of these commentaries. The manuscript has been held by the Schaffhausen Bibliotheca Publica in the Church of St. Johann since 1589.",

The Vatican had commissioned the bell from the foundry of his father, Luigi Valadier, who passed away in 1785, before the work on the bell was completed. The son Giuseppe completed the commission and in 1786 prepared a manuscript about this work, pairing each drawing with a written explanation in the form of a legend. First Valadier shows the foundry building (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0013/2v\">2v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0013/7r\">7r</a>); then, in an almost photographic wealth of detail and in vivid colors, he shows the process of producing the bell including the technique of the false bell and the casting in bronze (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0013/8v\">8v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0013/21r\">21r</a>).

            "Summary (English)" : "This paper manuscript, produced around 1700, mentions in its title Emperor Leopold (I, reigned 1658-1705). The identity of Giovanni Baptista Coene from Passau, named as author, remains obscure; no further information is available about him. — The names of metals and other materials that Coene used in experiments are not written out in the text, but are represented by alchemic symbols (planetary signs, etc.). Because these occur in large numbers, the text is not easily readable or understandable. Further evidence that the manuscript is rooted in alchemy comes from the fact that Coene refers to Paracelsus (1493/94-1541), e.g., in the short final chapter with the title “Che cosa il Balsamo Samech di Paracelso” (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0030/101\">101</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0030/102\">102</a>). Coene also mentions the “Testamentum” (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0030/99\">99</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0030/100\">100</a>) and names Raimundus Lullus (1232/33-1315/16) as its author; today it is considered a pseudo-Llull text. — Within the chapters, individual paragraphs are numbered, but in the last quarter of the manuscript this numbering seems to have been added later (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0030/81\">81</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0030/102\">102</a>). At the end of the manuscript, the numbering is incorrect (instead from p. 70ff. it should read correctly p. 97ff.). — The manuscripts was purchased in Italy in 1952.",

Wok is documented between 1499-1531; from 1518-1525 he held the position of chief justice of Moravia. In 1526 with this manuscript he produced an early exemplar of a “Probierbuch” (assay book), which treats several procedures for analyzing and further processing various ores and metals. The first part of the manuscript is divided into 40 chapters (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0038/4\">4</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0038/130\">130</a>); in the second part of the manuscript, the sections are not numbered (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0038/133\">133</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0038/420\">420</a>). Added at the end is a later (17th century?) table of contents (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0038/N1\">429</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0038/N16\">444</a>), which offers short summaries of the chapters. Assaying was of great importance to the practice of early modern mining and metallurgy. Near Eulenburg castle (Czech: hrad Sovinec), the ancestral home of the family in Northern Moravia, Wok himself was engaged in the mining of precious metals (Papajík 2005, pp. 198-200). In Wok, therefore, the mining entrepreneur and the assayer coincided in one person. Before 1924 the manuscript was part of the holdings of the library of the museum of the ‘Gymnasium’ or preparatory school (Czech: Knihovna gymnazijního muzea) in Troppau (Czech: Opava), a predecessor institution of the present library of the Silesian Museum (Czech: Knihovna Slezského zemského muzea). The manuscript has been lost since 1924. After a devastating fire in the spring of 1945, in which all accession books were destroyed, no documentation about the manuscript exists in the museum library today (information from 07-16-2015). David Papajík summarizes the current state of Czech research: “Vok also addresses theoretical aspects of mining. In 1526 he authored an extensive German language work of 420 pages on the topic, which, while it survived until the recent past and was held in the library of the museum of Opava, it was lost by 1924. We only know a description from 1881, produced by Josef Zukal. It is a great pity that this unique document about the understanding of mining of that time, has not survived into the present” (Papajík 2005, p. 200). The above-mentioned description from 1881 offers the following additional information “«Ms. chart. sec. XVI. Kl. Oct. bound in black <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0038/bindingA\">leather</a> without decoration, 420 pages […]. Mining flourished in the area of Eulenburg in the 15th and 16th century; thus the present work owes its creation to practical need. Without doubt it is Wok’s original manuscript and offers an interesting insight into the state of metallurgy of the time. The index in a different hand was added at a much later time; this fact as well as the great wear indicate that the book was in use for a long time (Zukal 1881, p. 15 f.). The manuscript was purchased in New York in 1955.",

Following the title page with a decorative frame in a gray color wash (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/2\">2</a>) and the table of contents (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/3\">3</a>), there are twelve panels of watercolored drawings that give an overview and a detailed view of the project. Seven illustrations are two-sided, one of them has a fold-out page. All texts in this manuscript are in Russian and in Cyrillic script. — The bridge was designed by Charles Baird (1766–1843), a Scottish engineer who had set up a business for metal casting, machine construction and shipbuilding in St. Petersburg and who had built a cast-iron bridge nearby in 1805/06. The manuscript’s bridge project, however, calls for a combination of a floating bridge and a drawbridge: the floating bridge, resting on pontoons, splits into two branches, which end in two drawbridges near the shore (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/4a\">4a</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/5\">5</a>), so that it is possible to cross the bridge even while a ship passes beneath it. Other panels show, for example, the lifting mechanism hidden in the pillars (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/14a\">14a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/16\">16</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/17\">17</a>) and one of the boat-like pontoons anchored in the bed of the Neva River (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/20a\">20a</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/ebs/0057/21\">21</a>). – The manuscript was purchased in Copenhagen in 1978.",

The work is remarkable in more ways than one: first, it was created in the rarely-used scroll format, a format reserved for, among others, universal chronicles, a genre to which this manuscript belongs. Second, a complex family tree, showing the descendants of Adam until the birth of Christ, runs the entire length (eight meters) of the manuscript. The columns of text of this impressive graphic document are accompanied by numerous drawings that resemble the style of Parisian works. Finally, this exemplar is not unique, since the municipal library of Reims owns a similar scroll (<a href=\"http://www.bm-reims.fr/Exploitation/Infodoc/digitalcollections/viewerpopup.aspx?seid=DESC_MARC_BREIMS_B514546101_MS_0061\">ms. 61</a>), which certainly was illustrated by the same master.",

The 13th century colophon informs us that this three-volumeValère Bible was a gift from Willencus of Venthône, dean of the lower church of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Sion (Glarier), to the community of canons of Sion around 1195, on the occasion of the feast of the Epiphany. This work can be associated with certain Carthusian bibles, especially with a bible in four volumes that belonged to a daughter of the Grande Chartreuse (Grenoble, B.M., Mss 14, 13, 25, 15 rés. (19-21 and 25)). The order of the Old Testament Books in theValère Bible does indeed show agreement on all points with that in the “Bible in four volumes.” Furthermore, the initial in the Book of Genesis from the Sion bible is practically identical with the “I” of Genesis from the Carthusian bible.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript, the end of which is damaged, belongs to the genre of giant Bibles created in central Italy between the mid-11th and mid-12th centuries in the context of the Gregorian reform. In the form that we know it today, this manuscript presents the first volume of a complete Bible which was composed of two separate and independent volumes. The second volume is missing at this time. The giant Bible of Sion contains the first part of the Old Testament according to the Vulgate: the Octateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth), the books of Kings, the Major Prophets, the twelve Minor Prophets, Job, and in the last part an incomplete selection of Psalms (Ps. 1-93:22a). This Bible has been held since its creation in the Cathedral Chapter Archive of Sion, to which it was probably presented by Bishop Ermenfroid (1055-1087/1092), who was among the leading figures behind the Gregorian reform in the dioceses of the Second Kingdom of Burgundy.",

The first part (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/1r/0/Sequence-2259\">1</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/113v/0/Sequence-2259\">113</a>) consists of a treatise on the Inquisition from 1359, the <i>De jurisdictione inquisitorum in et contra christianos demones invocantes</i> (with the chapter <i>De suspicione</i>: beginning on f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/95r/0/Sequence-2259\">95r</a>) by the Catalan Dominican Nicolau Eymeric, General Inquisitor of Aragon. This first part was produced in Naters in 1460 for Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, by the priest Cristoferus in Domo Lapidea (Im/Zum Steinhaus, Steinhauser) of Lalden, rector of the altar at the church in Naters. Three more manuscripts in the Supersaxo library are due to this same scribe, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0096\">S 96</a>, S 98 and especially <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0097\">S 97</a>, which among other texts contains a second copy of the <i>De jurisdictione inquisitorum</i>, produced in the same year, 1460. The second part (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/114r/0/Sequence-2259\">114</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/134r/0/Sequence-2259\">134</a>), with rubricated and partly decorated initials (e.g., on ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/114r/0/Sequence-2259\">114r</a> and <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/127r/0/Sequence-2259\">127r</a>), contains the <i>Historia Karoli Magni et Rotholandi</i> (also referred to as <i> The Chronicle of Pseudo-Turpin </i>; about the middle of the 12th century, sometimes attributed to Aimery Picaud), a tale about fictional wars conducted by Charlemagne in Spain and France. This work of propaganda for the Spanish Crusade and for the Pilgrimage to Compostela, which was particularly inspired by the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>, experienced great success in the Middle Ages. The third part (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/135r/0/Sequence-2259\">135</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/157r/0/Sequence-2259\">157</a>) contains synodal statutes issued by Walter Supersaxo in 1460; another copy thereof is preserved in the archives of the Cathedral Chapter of Sion (drawer 3, number 67/5). An note of ownership on the flyleaf f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RCap-0073/V1r/0/Sequence-2259\">V1r</a> indicates a certain Johannes Huser of Selkingen as the owner of RCap 73; he is attested in Sion between 1532 and 1561 as rector of two altars.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This Latin Bible contains the Books of the Old Testament (Octateuch, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Job and Maccabees). They are preceded by Jerome’s prologue to the whole of the Bible (in logical order: ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/11r/0/Sequence-2262\">11</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/13r/0/Sequence-2262\">13</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/14r/0/Sequence-2262\">14r</a>; the beginning is incomplete), by an excerpt from <i>De doctrina christiana </i>2, 8-9 by Saint Augustine (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/14r/0/Sequence-2262\">14</a>) and by Jerome’s prologue to the Pentateuch (in the order: f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/14v/0/Sequence-2262\">14v</a> then f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/9r/0/Sequence-2262\">9</a>). Several leaves at the beginning have been lost or were not bound correctly; the manuscript currently begins with Genesis 19.26. The incomplete text of Genesis should be read in this order: ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/9v/0/Sequence-2262\">9v</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/10v/0/Sequence-2262\">10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/15r/0/Sequence-2262\">15</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/16v/0/Sequence-2262\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/12r/0/Sequence-2262\">12</a> (Gn 10.30-19.26 are missing), <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/1r/0/Sequence-2262\">1</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/8v/0/Sequence-2262\">8</a> (Gn 31.28-36.19 are missing), <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/17r/0/Sequence-2262\">17</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/26r/0/Sequence-2262\">26r</a>.

There are several errors in the modern foliation: 3 leaves between ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/161r/0/Sequence-2262\">161</a> and <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/162r/0/Sequence-2262\">162</a> were not counted; the foliation jumps from f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/188r/0/Sequence-2262\">188</a> to f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/190r/0/Sequence-2262\">190</a>, and there is a f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/256ar/0/Sequence-2262\">256a</a>. RIKB 8 has a blue initial with red pen flourishes (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/9v/0/Sequence-2262\">9v</a>), as well as several simple initials in red, in part with geometrical motifs (e.g. on ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/69r/0/Sequence-2262\">69r</a> or <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/RIKB-0008/112r/0/Sequence-2262\">112r</a>).

The first part, printed around 1475 by Michael Wenssler in Basel (GW 7890), contains the <i>Speculum sapientiae</i>, which had erroneously been attributed to the holy bishop Cyril. This collection of 95 fables in Latin prose was probably compiled around 1337-1347 by the Italian Dominican Bongiovanni da Messina. The second part contains Aesop's fables in a Latin version in verse called “Fables by Anonymus Neveleti“ (after the name of the first publisher, Isaac Nicolas Nevelet, in the year 1610), which eventually were attributed to Gualterus Anglicus (12th century). This second, handwritten part was produced around 1474 by Georg Supersaxo’s anonymous scribe. It is comparable to other copies that were produced for Georg Supersaxo around 1472-1474, at the time that the young man studied law in Basel. This group of manuscripts includes the classical writers (Terence, Sallust …) as well as texts known only to scholars (Augustinus Datus, Gasparinus Barzizius …). Glued to the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0051/bindingE/0/Sequence-2765\">pastedowns</a> of S 51, there are parchment fragments with Latin excerpts from Aristotle’s <i>Physics</i> (Book IV, in the translation of James of Venice).",

            "Summary (English)" : "This volume, S 56, from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georg (ca. 1450-1529) in five parts brings together various Latin texts, classical texts as well as works by Italian humanists; the first two parts are printed (with initials in red and green), the latter three are handwritten. The first part, printed around 1472 by Michael Wenssler and Friedrich Biel in Basel (GW 3676), contains the <i>Epistolae</i> by the humanist and professor of rhetoric Gasparino Barzizza from Bergamo (ca. 1360-1431). This is followed by <i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i> by Boethius, also from the workshop of Michael Wenssler in Basel from about 1473-1474 (GW 4514). Next is the first handwritten text (incomplete, with marginal and interlinear glosses), <i>Jesuida seu De passione Christi</i> by the humanist and physician Girolamo della Valle from Padua († ca. 1458 or 1494). This work, written in hexameter and dedicated to Pietro Donato, Bishop of Padua from 1428 until 1447, was most likely copied from the edition of about 1474 that was printed by Michael Wenssler in Basel (GW M49385) and that also served as model for the lay-out. The fourth part contains the <i> Catiline conspiracy</i> by Sallust. At the end of the volume, the fifth part is made up of three works by two authors (with marginal and interlinear glosses; initials in red and green); due to a bookbinder’s error, the order of the quires is mixed up. This fifth part contains the <i>Elegantiolae</i> (the order for reading would be: ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_1r/0/Sequence-2250\">1r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_10v/0/Sequence-2250\">10v</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_27r/0/Sequence-2250\">27r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_38v/0/Sequence-2250\">38v</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_11r/0/Sequence-2250\">11r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_20r/0/Sequence-2250\">20r</a>) by the humanist and professor of rhetoric Agostino Dati from Siena (*1420 or 1428, †1478), as well as two treatises by Gasparino Barzizza, which are already included in the printed part, the <i>Praeceptorum summula</i> (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_20r/0/Sequence-2250\">20r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/-en/mvs/S-0056/5_21v/0/Sequence-2250\">21v</a>) and the <i>Modus orandi</i> (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_21v/0/Sequence-2250\">21v</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_26v/0/Sequence-2250\">26v</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_39r/0/Sequence-2250\">39r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/5_43r/0/Sequence-2250\">43r</a>). The three handwritten parts of the volume were produced by different hands, among them that of the anonymous scribe of Georg Supersaxo. S 56 therefore is comparable to the other manuscripts (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0051\">S 51</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0101\">S 101</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/mvs/S-0105\">S 105</a>) that were made for Georg Supersaxo at the time when the young man studied law in Basel (around 1472-1474). Among the annotations on the flyleaves one can recognize a note of ownership by his father Walter Supersaxon, Bishop of Sion (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0056/N2r/0/Sequence-2250\">N2r</a>).",

            "Summary (English)" : "At once a travel memoir and a geography book, the <i>Voyages</i> by John Mandeville, probably written around 1355-1357, were a great success in the Middle Ages. Numerous handwritten copies make it possible to distinguish three different versions of the French text, which gave rise to translations into Latin and into the vernacular languages. The oldest German translation, going back to about 1393-1399, is by Michel Velser, a member of the von Völs family (Völs, South Tyrol). This copy, S 94 from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georges (ca. 1450-1529), contains numerous ornamental initials, some zoomorphic or anthropomorphic. The <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0094/V2r/0/Sequence-2225\">endpapers</a> are parchment. Based on the language, the manuscript should be from Northern Switzerland. An ownership note on f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0094/120v/0/Sequence-2225\">120v</a> mentions an uncle “G”, which may suggest Georges Supersaxo himself. In the binding, there was a <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0094/fragment\">fragment</a> of a papal document that can without doubt be dated to the middle of the 13th century, from a Pope Innocent and addressed to the Abbot of Kempten. Ms. S 94 can be compared to another manuscript from the Supersaxo library, namely with <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0099\">S 99</a>, which contains a French version of the <i>Voyages</i>.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georg (ca. 1450-1529) is bound in a piece of parchment and is divided into several parts. The main part (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/2r/0/Sequence-2224\">2r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/43r/0/Sequence-2224\">43r</a>) is devoted to the statutes of Valais (<i>Statuten der Landschaft Wallis</i>). They are preceded by a table of contents in a version that is similar to the statutes (<i>Landrecht</i>) of 1511-1514 by the Bishop of Sion and Cardinal Mathieu Schiner, but with a different order of the articles and with important modifications and additions. On ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/65r/0/Sequence-2224\">65r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/69v/0/Sequence-2224\">69v</a>, the same scribe copied the statutes (<i>Kürzerung des Rechten</i>) promulgated in 1525, notably by Georg Supersaxo, and confirmed in 1550. This manuscript from the Supersaxo library therefore is merely a preliminary version of the <i>Statuta</i> of 1571. Only the manuscript from 1571, which is in the State Archives of Valais (AV 62/4) and which also exists in a German and a French version, became the normative base reference up until the promulgation of the Civil Code of Valais in 1852.<i> </i>Between these two versions of the statutes, on ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/51r/0/Sequence-2224\">51r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/54v/0/Sequence-2224\">54v</a>, is the testament of Johannes Grölin (Groely), citizen and former castellan of Sion (<i>civis et olim castellani dominorum civium Sedunensium</i>); the document is written by the notary Martin Guntern (1538-1588) on 8 January 1585 in Sion. Various notes from the years 1557-1590 are found at the beginning and end of the manuscript (on the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/bindingE/0/Sequence-2224\">front pastedown</a> and f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/1r/0/Sequence-2224\">1</a>; on ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/70v/0/Sequence-2224\">70v</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/77v/0/Sequence-2224\">77v</a> and on the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/bindingF/0/Sequence-2224\">back pastedown</a>). They are fragments of accounts and of jobs in several hands, among them that of Martin Guntern, together with notes relating to the birth of the children of Bartholomäus Supersaxo (†1591), the grandson of Georg Supersaxo. Martin Guntern was not only a notary, he was also an important political figure (especially state secretary from 1570 until his death), who played an important role in the writing and translation of the Statutes of Valais of 1571. Bartholomäus Supersaxo, who in 1565 left behind a note of ownership on the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0095/bindingF/0/Sequence-2224\">front pastedown</a> of S 95, was governor of Monthey (1565-1567), chaplain of Sion (1574) and Vize-Vogt - vice-reeve - (1579-1585); in 1573, he married his second wife, Juliana, daughter of Johannes Groely.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript unites three moral treatises from different epochs. It begins with the mirror for princes by the Dominican William Peraldus, <i>De eruditione principum</i>, written around 1265. This is followed by a short philosophical text by the Franciscan John of Wales, <i>Breviloquium</i>, from the second half of the 13th century, and then a moral treatise by Martin of Braga, <i>Formula vitae honestae</i>, a 6th century work that was widely distributed in the Middle Ages and that was attributed to Seneca for a long time. Intended for the Bishop of Sion Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), this manuscript was copied in 1463 by the priest Cristoferus in Domo Lapidea (Im/Zum Steinhaus, Steinhauser) of Lalden (parish of Visp), rector of the altar at the Church of St. Mauritius in Naters (fol. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0096/214v/0/Sequence-2227\">214v</a> und <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0096/220r/0/Sequence-2227\">220r</a>).

The version in S 97 contains the chapter <i>De suspicione</i> (beginning on f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097/104v/0/Sequence-2251\">104v</a>), which is sometimes considered a separate work; the table of contents was written on parchment (f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097/1r/0/Sequence-2251\">1</a>). In the second part of the manuscript (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097/132r/0/Sequence-2251\">132r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097/214r/0/Sequence-2251\">214r</a>), there is a version of the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> in 31 chapters, a famous collection of fables and moralizing tales that was probably written in Germany or England before 1342. The first part of manuscript S 97 was copied in 1460, the second part in 1465. The copyist was the priest Cristoferus in Domo Lapidea (Im/Zum Steinhaus, Steinhauser) of Lalden, rector of the altar of St. Fabian and St. Sebastian at the Church of S. Mauritius in Naters. This same scribe is also responsible for two more manuscripts in the Supersaxo library, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0096\">S 96</a> and S 98, which contain theological and moral works. In addition, in 1460, the same year as S 97, this scribe transcribed the <i>De jurisdictione inquisitorum</i> a second time; this version can be found in the first part of a composite manuscript in the library of the Capuchin monastery of Sion, in <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/RCap-0073\">RCap 73</a> (former shelfmark W 34).",

The major part of the manuscript (ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097bis/1r/0/Sequence-2252\">1r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097bis/122r/0/Sequence-2252\">122r</a>; initial in red, yellow and black on f. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097bis/1r/0/Sequence-2252\">1r</a>) is taken up by <i>Pontus </i><i>and Sidonia</i>, a work that experienced great success in the 15th and 16th century. This prose version of the Anglo-Norman romance <i>Horn</i>, sometimes attributed to Geoffroy de la Tour Landry, was written towards the end of the 14th century or the beginning of the 15th century in France. It is followed by two texts by Alain Chartier (*1385-1395, †1430), secretary and ambassador for the kings Charles VI and especially Charles VII: on ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097bis/122r/0/Sequence-2252\">122r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097bis/131r/0/Sequence-2252\">131r</a> is the famous <i>Bréviaire des nobles</i> (ca. 1422-1426) and on ff. <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097bis/131r/0/Sequence-2252\">131r</a>-<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0097bis/136v/0/Sequence-2252\">136v</a> is the <i>Lay de paix</i> (ca. 1424-1426).

This manuscript was transcribed in Martigny in 1474 (at least the first part, the romance of <i>Pontus </i><i>and Sidonia</i>) by Claude Grobanet, whom one also finds as the copyist of two more manuscripts in the Supersaxo library, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/mvs/S-0099\">S 99</a> (<i>Voyages</i> by Mandeville) and <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/mvs/S-0100\">S 100</a> (Statutes of Savoy). Grobanet was in the service of Antoine Grossi Du Châtelard, Lord of Isérables (†1495). In the beginning of the 16th century, the family of Antoine Du Châtelard apparently fell into financial difficulties; their property - and presumably the three manuscripts as well - passed into the hands of Georg Supersaxo.",

            "Summary (English)" : "At once a travel memoir and a geography book, the <i>Voyages</i> by John Mandeville, probably written around 1355-1357, were a great success in the Middle Ages. There are three versions of the French text; manuscript S 99 is related to the “continental” version. As in other manuscripts based on this version, the <i>Voyages</i> (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/1r/0/Sequence-2223\">1r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/122v/0/Sequence-2223\">122v</a>, with an <i>explicit</i> on f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/123v/0/Sequence-2223\">123v</a> and an addendum on ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/124r/0/Sequence-2223\">124r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/125r/0/Sequence-2223\">125r</a>) are followed by the <i>Preservacion de Epidimie</i> (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/122v/0/Sequence-2223\">122v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/123v/0/Sequence-2223\">123v</a>). The actual identity of the two authors is unresolved and may even have been confounded. In copy S 99 from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georges (ca. 1450-1529), the upper margins are covered with ornaments of ascending bars, some of which turn into into zoomorphic or anthropomorphic motifs. The Supersaxo library owns another version of the <i>Voyages</i>, namely <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0094\">S 94</a>, in the German translation by Michel Velser. Like two other manuscripts from this same library, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0097bis\">S 97bis</a> (composite manuscript with the romance of Pontus and Sidonia) and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0100\">S 100</a> (statutes of Savoy), S 99 was copied by Claude Grobanet, who was mentioned in a 1474 document in Martigny, where he served Antoine Grossi Du Châtelard, Lord of Isérables († 1495). In the beginning of the 16th century, the family of Antoine Du Châtelard apparently came into financial difficulties; their property - and probably the three manuscripts as well - passed into the hands of Georges Supersaxo. The incomplete parchment document, which makes up the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0099/bindingF/270/Sequence-2223\">rear flyleaf</a>, mentions, among others, Martigny, 147[3] and a seigneur d'Ys[érables (?)].",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript from the library of Walter Supersaxo (ca. 1402-1482), Bishop of Sion, and of his son Georges (ca. 1450-1529), contains a <i>compendium</i> of the statutes of Savoy, a legal code issued in 1430 by Amadeus VIII, the first Duke of Savoy and the future antipope Felix V. The <i>compendium</i> was printed for the first time in 1477 in Turin by Johannes Fabri (Hain 14050, GW M43623). Until 1475, this region of the canton of Valais below the river Morge of Conthey was ruled by the Dukes of Savoy. This manuscript, S 100, can be compared with two other manuscripts from the Supersaxo library, namely with <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0097bis\">S 97bis</a> (composite manuscript with the romance of Pontus and Sidonia) and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0099\">S 99</a> (John Mandeville, <i>Voyages</i>). All three manuscripts were copied by Claude Grobanet, who was mentioned in a 1474 document in Martigny, where he served Antoine Grossi Du Châtelard, Lord of Isérables († 1495). In the beginning of the 16th century, the family of Antoine Du Châtelard apparently came into financial difficulties; their property - and probably the three manuscripts as well - then passed into the hands of Georges Supersaxo.",

This codex is part of a group of manuscripts (<a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0051\">S 51</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/mvs/S-0056\">S 56</a>, <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/mvs/S-0105\">S 105</a>) that Georg Supersaxo himself made or had made during his studies in Basel (beginning in 1472).

These two manuscripts are very similar to one another regarding text and formatting. However, in contrast to codex S 105, which is written carefully and regularly and which is decorated with more elaborate initials, codex S 101 definitely is a manuscript for regular use. The initials and the rubrication soon discontinue. The <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0101/bindingA/0/Sequence-2158\">binding</a> is from the same workshop as that of codex <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0051/bindingA\">S 51</a>. Both have identical stamping, and the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mvs/S-0101/bindingE/0/Sequence-2158\">fragments</a>, which were used to reinforce the inside cover, are from the same manuscript.

Johannes de Blanosco († ca. 1281 or later) from Burgundy studied and probably also taught law in Bologna before returning home and placing himself in the service of Duke Hugo IV of Burgundy. In 1256, perhaps when he was still in Bologna, he wrote his commentary on the <i>Institutes</i> <i>“De actionibus“</i>. The author of the second treatise in this manuscript, Aegidius de Fuscarariis (†1289), was the first lay teacher for canon law at the University of Bologna. His <i>Ordo judiciarius</i> from 1263-1266 is his most important work. Tancred of Bologna (ca. 1185-ca. 1236), the author of texts 5 and 8, was a renowned canonist and archdeacon, who associated with Popes Innocent III, Honorius III and Gregory IX; among his works, the <i>Summa de sponsalibus et matrimonio</i>, written around 1210-1214 and revised by Raymond of Penyafort in 1235, enjoyed some success. But he became famous through his <i>Ordo judiciarius</i> (ca. 1214-1216), which established itself throughout Europe as the reference work for legal procedure. Regarding the four anonymous (or not-securely attributed) treatises of manuscript S 102: number 3, better known by the title <i>Ulpianus de edendo</i>, was probably created in England in 1140-1170; number 4 prior to 1234 in France (its author is a certain Gualterus, perhaps identical to Gauthier Cornu, Archbishop of Sens); number 6, from the time of the papacy of Gregory IX, may be of Anglo-Norman origin; and finally number 7, which was written in the North of France in two versions in 1221 and 1238. The Supersaxo library contains numerous legal works. S 102 can best be compared with manuscript <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/mvs/S-0104\">S 104</a> (Goffredus Tranensis, <i>Summa super titulis Decretalium</i>), which likewise is a 14th century work from Bologna.",

            "Summary (English)" : "The Hornbach Sacramentary is an important work of Ottonian book decoration. It was made before 983 at Reichenau for the Benedictine Abbey of Hornbach (Palatinate). The manuscript is also called the \"Eburnant-Codex\" in honor of the scribe who wrote it. It was probably acquired by the Cathedral library at Solothurn in 1439. It is listed as item No. 38, <i>Colleccionarius Antiquus</i>, in the catalog of provost Felix Hemmerli. The political programme of Charlemagne included the standardization of religious life following the example of the Roman liturgy from the time of Pope Gregory the Great. To follow this practice, one used a \"sacramentary\" containing the prescribed prayers and mass texts. This version was replaced by the \"missale curiae\" in about 1220.",

The legendary was still used in the middle of the 16th century in Fulda by <a href=\"http://www.lagis-hessen.de/pnd/118807757\">Georg Witzel</a> (1501-1573) for his <i><i><a href=\"http://gateway-bayern.de/VD16+W+3930\">Hagiologium seu de sanctis ecclesiae</a></i> </i>(Mainz 1541) as well as for his <a href=\"http://gateway-bayern.de/VD16+W+3890\"><i><i>Chorus sanctorum omnium. </i></i><i><i>Zwelff Bücher Historien Aller Heiligen Gottes</i></i></a><i> </i>(Köln 1554). Other fragments from this third volume are in Basel and Nuremberg. It shows that this volume, and at least the 6th volume (November-December) of the legendary as well, reached Basel, where both evidently were used as manuscript waste around 1580. The P-initial <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/staso/R0001-0001-0017\">1r</a> has a representation of Boniface inside the bowl of the initial; below that is Rugger, who commissioned the legendary.",

The individual elements were produced independently of one another during the 9th or 10th century. Some are incomplete, lacking the beginning, the ending, or both. Nevertheless, this composite manuscript received attention from early on, as some of the component parts are important for the texts they transmit. This volume contains the only early medieval transmissions of the Langobard Chronicle by Andreas Bergamensis and the life of the Irish saint Findan. The \"Admonitio ad filium\" by the Greek church father Basilius and the \"Visio Pauli\", an early christian vision of the afterlife, are among the oldest of textual artifacts.",

It goes by the title <i>Grössere Chronik der Äbte</i> (Great Chronicle of the Abbots). In this work, Vadian describes the way the abbey town changed into a self-reliant, independent city and became wealthy from the cloth weaving industry. The historical work is simultaneously a work of heated reformist protest, exposing and often bitingly commenting upon the increasing corruption of church dignitaries and institutions, particularly the Abbots and Abbey of St. Gall since the investiture conflict.",

In addition to its function as evangelistary, memorial and record of the monastic brotherhood, the <i>Liber viventium</i> was later also used to preserve the historial records and treasure catalog of Pfäfers Abbey. Because of the legal importance of the <i>Liber viventium</i> up to modern times, the volume is housed in the archival collection of Pfäfers Abbey.",

His chronicle is considered an important source of political and social life in the \"Alt Fry Rätien\" of the time. Not until the 1870s was Hans Ardüser’s chronicle discovered and published by cantonal high school principal J. Bott from Grisons. A large part of the chronicle consists of reports about political events at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century. In his work Ardüser also mentions crimes and the execution of witches; among other things he reports about extraordinary weather events and consequent crop failures. From his autobiographical nots, which are recorded in the \"Rätische Chronik\" (Raetian chronicle) as well, it becomes clear that Ardüser was a gifted reader. We can conclude that he obtained his knowledge about all of these topics from written sources such as parish registers, circulating news bulletins, official publications and personal contacts to officials, returning mercenary soldiers or traveling merchants.",

Among others, it contains sermons by Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, Nikolaus von Straßburg, Rudolf Goltschlacher, Meister Wilhelm, Felix Fabri (?), Jordan von Quedlinburg and several from the <i>corpus</i> of the „St. Georgener“ and „Engelberger Predigten“.

It consists of five pieces of sheep parchment, sewn together, and later folded to quarto format. On the front, there is an orginal plan of a monastery complex with 52 buildings, 333 explanatory annotations in Latin, and a letter of dedication. Probably based on models, it was created at Reichenau under Abbot Heito or Erlebald for (Abbot?) Gozbert of St. Gall (819 or around 827/830); annotations were added by the Librarian Reginbert and a younger brother. On the formerly blank back side (and on the erasure at the lower left on the front), was added the <i>Vita beati Martini episcopi </i> based on Sulpicius Severus (created in St. Gall at the end of the 12th century).",

Several of the <i>Sermones</i> have been identified to be by, for example, St. Ivo, Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux, Pope Gregory the Great, the Venerable Bede, Heimo of Auxerre or John Chrysostom. The codex was acquired for the library of the Monastery of St. Gall in 1780 by the St. Gall monk Gall Metzler (1743–1820), who at the time was parish priest in Ebringen near Freiburg im Breisgau.",

The beginning (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1253/5\">pp. 5</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1253/50\">50</a>) consists of copies of certificates of admission for pastoral care of St. Gall conventuals in the territory of the Diocese of Konstanz, issued by the episcopal chancery in Konstanz between 1551 and 1571. The second part (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1253/131\">pp. 131</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1253/134\">134</a>) gives a description of the laying of the foundation stone for the Renaissance library of St. Gall Abbey on Juli 6, 1551; it also lists the names of all persons present for this festive ceremony. The Renaissance library was completed in 1553 and was replaced with the late Baroque library between 1758 and 1767. The third part (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1253/181\">pp. 181</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1253/183\">183</a>) treats the creation of a large silver altar cross by the goldsmith Thomas Gennius from Wil; St. Gall Abbot Diethelm Blarer commissioned it in 1553 and had the <i>sculptor</i> (sculptor?) Heinrich Reissi, who was from Rapperswil but was active in Wil, carry it to St. Gall on his back in six hours. Also mentioned are the saints relics kept in this cross. All traces of the cross are lost during the liquidation of the assets of St. Gall Abbey after the dissolution of the monastery in 1805.

Mostly in Latin but often also in German, the manuscript describes the worship practices of the Monastery of St. Gall in the course of the year from January 1 to December 31. This <i>Directorium cultus divini</i> is one of the most important sources of information about the monastic liturgy in the monastery after the Reformation. It refers to prayers and chants that were said and sung on certain days or to the order of liturgical processions (even separately for days of fair versus bad weather). The volume contains directions for the decoration of the church and numerous notes that are interesting for their cultural history, such as those relating to the St. Gall custom of naming a boy abbot (<i>abbas scholasticus</i>). In addition to a list of anniversaries, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1262/1\">p. 1</a> also contains historical notes about various events internal to the monastery.

Joseph von Rudolphi (1717−1740), abbot of St. Gall, commissioned this copy in 1738, because, after studying the <i>Chronicon Helveticum</i>, the great historical work by the scholar Aegidius Tschudi (1505−1572) of Glarus, and a copy thereof that he had arranged to have made for his monastery shortly before from the exemplar at Schloss Gräpplang near Flums (Cod. Sang. 1213−1220), he had found certain discrepancies with an older copy of the “Wappenbuch von Sempach”. A colorful painting of the battle has survived as a sort of frontispiece on a parchment bifolio (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1276/V6-V7\">6−7</a>); it is similar to the painting in the Schlachtkapelle (“battle chapel”) of Sempach and, according to Franz Weidmann’s manuscript catalog (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1405/2002\">Cod. Sang. 1405, p. 2002</a>), it was “von einem gar alten Kupferstich getreülich abgemalet worden” (faithfully copied from a quite old copperplate print). Apparently Joseph Leodegar Bartholomäus Tschudi (1708−1772), a descendant of Aegidius Tschudi, is responsible for the book decoration (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1276/V1\">V1</a>). After extensive introductory comments, the volume’s rich ornamentation with the coats of arms begins with a portrait of Duke Leopold III (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1276/34\">34</a>).",

He quietly omitted from the catalog all manuscripts where an author was not given, such as copies of the Bible, or Psalters, or texts by unknown authors. The manuscripts bear the signatures of the older manuscript catalog by Father Hermann Schenk (1653-1706) from the period before 1700 (cf. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/1280\">Cod. Sang. 1280</a>; circa Class. 1, n. 44). Father Pius Kolb, Abbey Librarian from 1748, added the new signatures introduced by him (cf. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/1400\">Cod. Sang. 1400</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/1401\">1401</a>, circa D.n. 88). to the earlier signatures in the Zeller mansucript catalog.

Oktober 1780 bis Ende Mayes 1792 der Stift St. Gallischen Bibliotheke sind einverleibt worden</i>. This volume thus is a unique document of the acquisition policy and practice of the Monastery of St. Gall. In barely twelve years, a total of 335 incunabula and postincunabula, around 4,000 later printed works, as well as 146 manuscripts were integrated into the library. Most of these manuscripts came to the current abbey library (in exchange for printed literature of ascetic-spiritual character) from St. Gall women’s cloisters such as the Benedictine nuns of St. George, the Capuchin nuns of Altstätten or the Dominican nuns of Wil. Accessions to the coin collection, the natural history collection, and the cabinet of curiosities, new acquisitions of paintings and prints, as well as <i>alia quaedam bibliothecae illata </i> (diverse other acquisitions of various types such as chairs made of Spanish cane or a new library seal) are mentioned. Also listed are general expenditures for bookbinding as well as monetary contributions owed to the library by those officials and clergy onto whom the abbot had newly conferred a secular office or a parish.",

It begins with a treatise on simony, in Latin and German, which was written by ‘brůder Johannes’ and dedicated to ‘der erwurdigen frowen von Mulhein’, presumably Veronica von Mülheim, who was abbess of the convent from December 1504 until her death in May 1508. Johannes may have been a monk from Tennenbach, the Cistercian monastery which had responsibility for the <i>cura animarum</i> of the nuns. The rest of the manuscript contains a number of translations of normative texts from the Cistercian order, including the <i>Liber definitionum</i> and the <i>Ecclesiastica Officia</i>. Their use for nuns is highlighted by the German translations and the inclusion of only relevant chapters. Many of these were also transmitted in the Cistercian nuns’ convent of Lichtenthal, near Baden-Baden. Although the convent was never formally reformed, the manuscript points to reforming impulses in the early part of the sixteenth century. The manuscript was bought in 1782 by the St. Gall monk Gall Metzler (1743-1820), parish priest in Ebringen near Freiburg, which was owned by St. Gall.",

It was dedicated to the convent’s abbess, Maria Störin von Störenberg. Following a prologue by Lorichius on the usefulness of liturgical ceremonies, the author provides the nuns with German translations of two of the founding texts of the Cistercian order from the twelfth century: the <i>Exordium Cistercii</i>, a narrative of the early history of the order, and the <i>Ecclesiastica Officia</i>, a set of regulations for liturgical and monastic life. It concludes with a short justification of why Cistercians pray the Seven Penitential Psalms on a Friday. A set of statutes (the <i>Usus Conversorum</i>) for lay brothers, translated into German, is appended. Lorichius dedicated four printed books to the nuns of Günterstal between 1581 and 1598, all in German, and this manuscript must be seen as part of this wider relationship.",

According to Metzler’s statement on p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1346/1\">1</a>, he copied a codex from Bobbio written in Irish script (<i>ex manuscripto codice monasterii Bobiensis, litteris Hibernicis confecto</i>) ; however, this codex has not survived until today. Metzler might have produced the copy in 1611 during a stay at Bobbio on one of his travels to Rome. This manuscript is the only textual witness for Columbanus’ letters I-V. It is conceivable that Metzler’s copy is based on the same codex as Patrick Fleming’s posthumously published (<i>Collectanea sacra</i>, Löwen 1667 ; in 1623, Fleming copied two manuscripts from Bobbio that have also been lost.)",

            "Summary (English)" : "Abbot Otmar Kunz’s (1564−1577) small format prayer book, with several pages of rich decoration (flowers, vines, animals), was written and illustrated in 1574 by unknown artists. Especially noteworthy are two full page miniatures. On p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1365/4\">4</a>, Abbot Otmar Kunz, dressed in ceremonial regalia, kneels in a landscape with a city, hills and trees, above him is God with the terrestrial globe and with his hand raised in blessing. On p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1365/10\">10</a>, the St. Gall abbot, dressed in a simple monk’s habit, kneels with Mary and John beneath the Cross of Christ. The prayer book contains (from p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1365/11\">11</a> on) the so-called 5 Passion Psalms (Ps 22, 31, 55, 69, 109). These are followed by the 15 Gradual Psalms, the vigil for the deceased, as well as the 7 Penitential Psalms with the Litany of the Saints. After the death of Abbot Otmar, a scribe with the initials <i>FVF</i> added a prayer (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1365/105\">105</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1365/109\">109</a>); probably this was Brother Ulpianus Fischer from Überlingen, who joined the Abbey of St. Gall in 1583. In 1594, the former abbot’s prayer book belonged to St. Gall monk Georg Spengler († 1609), who was born in Wil. In 1599 the manuscript received its current <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1365/bindingA\">binding</a> with blind stamp decoration.",

Ildefons von Arx (1755−1833). This is the oldest catalog of manuscripts from St. Gall; it lists the manuscripts in the order of the shelfmarks introduced in 1780/82 and still valid today: from Cod. Sang. 1 to Cod. Sang. 1399. The catalog begins with a brief history of the cataloguing of manuscripts at St. Gall Abbey up to this time (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1402/1\">1</a>). Then the following, usually very brief information is provided in rubrics and columns (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1402/2\">2</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1402/239\">239</a>), each codex taking up one double page: a) the manuscript’s shelfmark; b) the date (usually in centuries); c) the format of the codex and the old shelfmark from F. Pius Kolb’s manuscript catalog (cf. Cod. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/1400\">1400</a>/<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/1401\">1401</a>); d) the author and title of the manuscript, sometimes a short summary of its contents; e) the incipit of the manuscript; f) a specification of the number of the last page, sometimes the explicit of the manuscript; g) the scribe, script, writing material, binding, former owner; h) general relevant information about the codex. In 1846 Carl Johann Greith (1807−1882), who later headed the abbey library and who, for the last twenty years of his life, was Bishop of St. Gall, completed the catalog with identically ordered information for codices 1400 to 1500 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1402/240\">240</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1402/257\">257</a>).

In the second part he recounts, in chronological order, important episodes and stories about the lay brothers from the 15th century to the year 1793 (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1426/22r\">22r</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1426/79v\">79v</a>). A third part lists the names of all the lay brothers who were part of the community from the abbacy of Eglolf Blarer (1426−1442) until 1793 (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1426/89r\">89r</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1426/101r\">101r</a>). Between parts 2 and 3 the author inserted, like a transcript and written by another hand, serious exhortations by Prince-Abbot Beda Angehrn (1767−1796) to the lay brothers from the year 1775 (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1426/80r\">80r</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1426/83v\">83v</a>). Because of several problems, the St. Gall abbot had called all the lay brothers to him. The manuscript’s frontispiece (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1426/4v\">4v</a>) shows a lay brother in 16th century garb.",

Volumes 2 to 6 of the <i>Sacrarium</i> have the shelfmarks Cod. Sang. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/searchresult/list/one/csg/1719\">1719</a>−1723. This volume lists the cult objects such as chalices, statues, monstrances, candle holders, small altars, patens, censers, reliquaries, etc. that made up the church treasure of the Monastery of St. Gall in the year 1693. This overview, compiled and written by Father Gregor Schnyder (1642-1708) and dedicated to the Prince-Abbot of St. Gall Cölestin Sfondrati (1687−1696), includes historical information about the individual cult objects and illustrates these objects with 60 realistic images in opaque colors. This register is of great importance today since many of the objects were lost, were seized or were melted down during the military invasions by troops from Zurich and Bern in 1712, by the French in May 1789, through the secularization of the monastery in 1805 and the following liquidation of a great part of the abbey’s property. Various works by renowned gold- and silversmiths of the early modern period (including Hans Jacob Bayr, Augsburg; Heinrich Domeisen, Rapperswil; Fidel Ramsperg, Appenzell; Johannes Renner, Wil) can be reconstructed only through this <i>Hierogazophylacium</i> (German: Heiligschatzbehälter, ‘container of holy treasure). Other cult objects are still part of the cathedral treasure of St. Gall today, such as the Spoon of St. Gall (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1718a/170b\">170b</a>), which remains in liturgical use today, or the small reliquary monstrance containing parts of the sackcloth belt and robe of St. Gall (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1718a/168b\">168b</a>). In his compilation Fr. Gregor Schnyder paid special attention to the relics contained in the various objects; he noted their origin and copied certificates about their authenticity. This volume is introduced by a frontispiece in shades of brown (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1718a/V7\">IIIr</a>), which shows the founding legend of the Monastery of St. Gall with the Church of St. Gall as it appeared around 1693 in the background.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This volume, written almost exclusively in Latin, contains a compilation of texts taken from numerous older sources about transfers of saints in the territory of the Princely Abbey of Saint Gall. The St. Gall monk and custos Gregor Schnyder (1642−1708) compiled and wrote the text, mostly in chronological order, and presented it to Abbot Leodegar Bürgisser (abbot 1696−1717) on 19 April 1699, his name day. The illustrations in opaque colors were done by Father Gabriel Hecht (1664−1745). At the beginning there are descriptions of the various transfers of the relics of Saint Gall between about 640 and 1484 (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/V18\">IXv</a> – p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/20\">20</a>) and those of Saint Othmar between 759 and 1692 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/24_002\">24b</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/99\">99</a>). This is followed by reports about the transfers of the relics of Notker Balbulus as well as of his beatification in 1513 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/104_002\">104b</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/163\">163</a>) and about the dislocation of the relics of Othmar and Notker that was necessitated by the new construction of the church of Othmar (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/169\">169</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/286\">286</a>). Next are reports of donations of relics of various saints from and of the Abbey of St. Gall (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/287\">287</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/354\">354</a>), among them reports about the arrival of the relics of the saints Magnus (898), Constantius of Perugia (904), Remaclus of Stavelot (1035), Faith of Agen (1084), Charles Borromeo (1611), Sigisbert and Placidus from Disentis Abbey (1624) and Bishop Landolo of Treviso (1631), which were particularly revered in the Abbey of St. Gall. The back part of the manuscript contains compilations of documents and reports about the 17th century transfers of Roman catacomb saints to the territory of the Princely Abbey of Saint Gall: there are descriptions (including the respective background and festivities) of the transfer of Honoratus to the Abbey Church of St. Gall in 1643 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/367_002\">367b</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/453\">453</a>), of Antoninus and Theodorus to the Abbey Church of St. Gall in 1654 and to Neu St. Johann Abbey in 1685 and of Antonius to the Abbey Church of St. Gall in 1654 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/458\">458</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/507\">507</a>), of Leander to the Capuchin Convent Maria der Engel near Wattwil in 1652 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/508\">508</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/513\">513</a>), of Marinus to Lichtensteig in 1657 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/518\">518</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/530\">530</a>), of Theodora to the Cistercian Convent Magdenau in 1662 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/533\">533</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/539\">539</a>), of Pancratius to Wil in 1672 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/541\">541</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/571\">571</a>), of Constantius to Rorschach in 1672 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/573\">573</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/644\">644</a>), of Laureatus to Wildhaus in 1676 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/647\">647</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/682\">682</a>), and of Sergius, Bacchus, Hyacinthus and Erasmus to the Abbey Church of St. Gall in 1680 (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/687\">687</a>–<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/1719/747\">747</a>).",

As conclusion to the long-term dispute about cultural assets between St. Gall and Zurich, the Canton of Zurich donated these fragments to the Abbey Library of St. Gall on 27 April 2006. The leaves are from a passionary; they contain eleven partially fragmentary chapters of the oldest version of the life of St. Gall (<i>Vita sancti Galli vetustissima</i>) as well as the beginnings of the Passions of the evangelist Luke and the apostles Simon and Judas. The latter text (for October 28th) has the number 80, suggesting that the passionary once comprised more than 90 texts.",

The beginning of the Office of the Virgin as well as possibly a calendar preceding it have been lost. The fact that the patron saints of St. Gall, St. Gall and St. Othmar (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/56r\">56r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/56v\">56v</a>; fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/58r\">58r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/58v\">58v</a>), are the only saints mentioned other than Mary and St. Benedict suggests a provenience from the Monastery of St. Gall. The manuscript is written in Gothic script; it is decorated with numerous initials executed in gold leaf and with colorful vine scrolls in the margins of individual pages. The beginning of the Office of the Dead (fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/69r\">69r</a>) is adorned with a small miniature of a catafalque bordered by two Benedictine monks, one of which is holding a prayer book in his hands. The cut leather binding with the monogram S, created by a master whose name is unknown, is particularly noteworthy. The covers show the two Princes of the Apostles, Peter (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/bindingA\">front cover</a>, with book and key) and Paul (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/bindingC\">back cover</a>, with book and sword), surrounded by rich vine scroll ornamentation. The Abbey Library of St. Gall was able to acquire this manuscript in June 2006 at a Christie’s auction in New York from the collection of the American brewer Cornelius J. Hauck (1893−1967) from Cincinnati (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2107/bindingE\">Ex Libris</a> on the inside front cover).",

The volume contains the incipits of the chants for Vespers (antiphons and hymns), written in German plainsong notation (“Hufnagelnotation”) on five lines, for the feasts of Jesus Christ and of the saints for the entire liturgical year. It is divided into the parts <i>Proprium de tempore</i> (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2135/1\">1</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2135/36\">36</a>), <i>Proprium sanctorum</i> (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2135/37\">37</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2135/80\">80</a>) and <i>Commune sanctorum</i> (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2135/81\">81</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2135/92\">92</a>). This manuscript was held in the choir library of St. Gallen Cathedral until 1989. Then it was transferred to the archives of the cathedral parish of St. Gall, and in 2014 it came to the Abbey Library of St. Gall. The volume, which consisted of 96 pages in 1774, was certainly used for the liturgy in the Cathedral of St. Gall until the 1930s. The mostly handwritten additions and supplements (after p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/2135/97\">97</a>) date from the 19th century. Also glued and bound into the volume are texts from unspecified printed liturgical publications of the 19th and early 20th century.

The first part dates from the second half of the 9th century, the second from the middle of the 9th century. The volume was privately owned by the St. Gall Abbot Grimald (841-872); however, it was probably written not in St. Gall, but at least in part at a scriptorium in the southern region of Germany. It contains various works by Alcuin of York (about 730-804): <i>De fide sanctae et individuae trinitatis</i>; <i>De trinitate et ad Fredegisum quaestiones XXVIII</i>; <i>De animae ratione ad Eulaliam virginem</i>; <i>Dialogus de rhetorica et de virtutibus</i> (with diagrams <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0276/210\">p. 210</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0276/217\">217</a>); <i>De Dialectica</i> (with diagram <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0276/270\">p. 270</a>). The codex further contains excerpts (chapters 2-11) from <i>De perfectione iustitiae hominis</i> by the Church Father Augustine (in the codex under the titel <i>Adnotatio interrogationum caelesti pelagiani et responsionum sancti augustini</i>). On <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0276/148\">p. 148</a> there is a 13th century pen trial of the alleluia <i>Conversus Iesus ad mariam dixit ei fides tua te salvum fecit vade in pace</i> (with neumes); on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0276/218\">p. 218</a> (11th/12th century) the antiphon <i>Conspicit in celis mens prudens Ezechielis</i> (with neumes) as well as the responsorium <i>Martir sancta dei quae flagrans igne fidei</i> (without neumes). On <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0276/271\">p. 271</a> there is the figure of a man with sword and shield etched with a stylus; an almost identical figure can be found in <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0175/356\">Cod.

Nevertheless, this is probably not a manuscript from the reformed monastery of Marbach in Alsace. Based on the offices, which indicate a connection with St. Gall, it must rather be assumed that the manuscript originated in the monastery of the Canons Regular of St. Lawrence in Ittingen, which belonged to the monastery of St. Gall, but which followed the <i>Consuetudines</i> of Marbach. The fly leaf (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0437/2\">p. 2/1</a>) contains a large part of the Office of St. Gallus, probably from a manuscript from the 10th/11th century.

The second part (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0443/27\">pp. 27</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0443/86\">86</a>) consists of two discourses in defense of polyphonic music, composed by St. Gall monk Mauritius Enck († 1575) at the behest of Abbot Diethelm Blarer (1530-1564). These discourses are meant as prefaces to Manfred Barbarini Lupus’ compositions for several voices in <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0542\">Cod. Sang. 542</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0543\">543</a>. Enck defends polyphonic music against widespread criticism, for example for its presumed <i>lascivia</i> (wantonness), and postulates an ideal for church music consisting of a combination with a chorale as the foundation and figural music as embellishment. Thus he describes precisely the compositions of Barbarini Lupus. At the end of the first discourse (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0443/47\">pp. 47</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0443/48\">48</a>), Enck names the artists who contributed to <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0542\">Cod. Sang. 542</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/csg/0543\">543</a> as well as the time period of their work on the manuscripts (from 1561 to 1563).",

Organized according to the ecclesiastical calendar, this volume contains German-language instructions for the preparation of the altars and ceremonies of the St. Gallen Monastery on the individual Sundays and holidays. In addition, it offers an alphabetical listing of all the altars in the post-Reformation monastery district of St. Gall. At that time, the duties of a sacristan were in the hands of a lay brother, who cleaned the church, lit the candles and monitored them while they burned, and rang the church bells (hence the name \"Läuterbuch\").",

Before as well as after the Reformation, Fridolin Sicher was cathedral organist and calligrapher for St. Gall Abbey.

Starting in 1512, while he was a pupil of the organist Hans Buchner in Konstanz, Sicher gathered 176 pieces by 94 composers (including Paul Hofhaimer, Hans Buchner, Jacob Obrecht, Josquin Desprez, Matthaeus Pipelaere) together in this volume. Two thirds are sacred vocal pieces, the rest are originally secular songs. The descant is in measured notation on a five line staff, while the remaining vocal parts are indicated with alphabet letters and rhythmical symbols. Some of the compositions may be found only in this particular organ book.",

The latter is a free adaptation of the 12th century legend of the founding of the Abbey on the Rhine. Using the cut leather (cuir-ciselé) technique, an artist cut central figures of the foundation legend (probably St. Benedict, Eberhard of Nellenburg, Burkhard of Nellenburg, Wilhelm of Hirsau?) into the front and back of the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0604/bindingA/0/Sequence-614\">cover</a>. On p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0604/204\">204</a>, there is a pen sketch of the saints Benedict and Bernard. At an unknown date, the manuscript came into the possession of the scholar Aegidius Tschudi of Glarus and, together with his literary estate, was bought by the Monastery of St. Gall in February 1768.",

Based on an examination of the handwriting, in the older literature it is considered that the early humanist Felix Hemmerli (1388/89−1454) from Zurich may have been the scribe. The manuscript was owned by the Swiss scholar Aegidius Tschudi (1505−1572) and was sold to the monastery of St. Gall by his family in February 1768. Tschudi added various marginal notes and corrections to the texts.",

The greatest part of the notes in this volume, collected, compiled and ordered with great diligence by Tschudi, concern what today is France (Gaul with its tribes, provinces, cities, mountains, islands, etc.). Especially noteworthy are the maps Tschudi has drawn of varies parts of Gaul (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0663/706-2\">706</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0663/723-2\">723</a>). Among them are a map of Franche-Comté (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0663/714-2\">714</a>/<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0663/715-2\">715</a>) and of the western parts of Switzerland (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0663/717-718\">717/718</a>). After Tschudi’s death in 1572, the three sheaves which make up the current volume remained in the possession of his family, and from 1652 until 1768 they were held at Gräpplang Castle near Flums. In February 1768 they came to the Abbey Library of St. Gall, which purchased the Glarus scholar’s estate of manuscripts. In St. Gall, the three sheaves, which were listed as numbers 59, 43 and 44 in the auction catalog of 1767, were bound together with several more leaves into the current volume between 1768 and 1782.",

The largest portion of the fragments, which were bound together in the present volume by Abbey Librarian Ildefons von Arx in 1822, is found at the Abbey Library of St. Gall. In 1972, the fragmental parchment leaves of the Edictum Rothari owned by the Abbey Library of St. Gall were rebound into a new volume, in a fashion that does not exactly follow conservational guidelines, together with black and white photos of the fragments that are in Karlsruhe and Zurich. The photos were then removed from this by restorer Martin Strebel in 2008. At the same time, this manuscript, which is significant to the history of law, was rebound using the latest book restoration techniques, thanks to the Friends of the Abbey Library of St. Gall, which covered the costs of the work.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This manuscript, illustrated with numerous colored pen drawings, originated in a secular environment in Southern Germany or in Switzerland around the middle of the 15th century. It describes the signs of the zodiac, the planets, the four temperaments, and the four seasons regarding their influence on human health. This is followed by dietary guidelines primarily regarding bloodletting, but also regarding eating, drinking, sleeping, waking, resting and moving, as well as, in concrete terms, regarding bathing (illustration <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0760/101\">p. 101</a>) or defecating (illustration <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0760/120\">p. 120</a>). Most likely an amateur doctor with an interest in astronomy, from the Southern region of Germany, wrote the original text around 1400 and assembled it into a compendium. Later the text was repeatedly supplemented and modified. The last part (from <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0760/128\">p. 128</a> on) contains a prose and a poem version of the so-called letter from Pseudo-Aristotle to Alexander the Great, in which the Greek universal scholar advises the king on maintaining good health.",

According to the note of ownership on fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0840/209v\">209v</a> (<i>Liber monasterii sancti Galli</i>), this volume probably was part of the Abbey  Library of St. Gall around 1500. Prior to that the volume probably was held in Eastern Switzerland, as suggested by notes on fol. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0840/1r\">1r</a> (naming <i>Wernher Müntzmaister; Jakob Grübel; Albert von Glarus</i>). From 1422 on, Theoderici was professor of the theological faculty at the universities of Rostock, Leipzig and Greifswald; it has been verified that in the 15th century there were students from St. Gall in Leipzig.",

The coat of arms on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0850/3\">p. 3</a> (four bearded male faces in profile, arranged in a circle) most likely was that of the later Pope Nicholas V, born Tommaso Parentucelli (1397–1455, Pope 1447–1455). Parentucelli used this coat of arms (“stemma delle quattro barbe”, Manfredi, p. 662) in the years before he was elected pope. It is found in 38 manuscripts in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana in Rome as well as in a codex in the Biblioteca Capitolare in Padua (ms. C27). The white vine initials, typical of Florentine book decoration, are similar to those in the codex from Padua, whose illuminations Silvia Fumian attributes to the Florentine artist Bartolomeo Varnucci (* ca. 1412/1413). Perhaps Parentucelli commissioned this manuscript in 1439–1443, when he resided in Florence for the Council.",

It contains “Parzival” (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/5\">pp. 5</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/288\">288</a>; version D) by Wolfram von Eschenbach, the Song of the Nibelungs (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/291\">pp. 291</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/416\">416</a>; version B) with the following lament (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/416\">pp. 416</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/451\">451</a>; version B), the poem “Karl der Grosse” (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/452\">pp. 452</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/558\">558</a>; version C) by der Stricker, the verse narrative “Willehalm” (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/561\">pp. 561</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/691\">691</a>; version G) by Wolfram von Eschenbach, as well as five sung gnomic verses by Friedrich von Sonnenburg (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0857/693\">p. 693</a>; version G). \r\nUntil 1768, when the manuscript was purchased by the Monastery of St. Gall, this volume certainly also contained fragments of the epic poems “Die Kindheit Jesu” by Konrad von Fussesbrunnen and <i>Unser vrouwen hinvart</i> by Konrad von Heimesfurt. These two works were removed from the manuscript of epic poems before 1820 and are now held in the Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz in Berlin (mgf 1021) and the Badische Landesbibliothek in Karlsruhe (Cod. K 2037), respectively. The manuscript, illustrated with 78 uniformly executed initials by unknown artists from the miniature painting school of Padua, was commissioned by a wealthy client who was interested in Middle High German epic poems. The first owner known by name was the Swiss polymath and universal scholar Aegidius Tschudi (1505−1572) from Glarus, whose estate of manuscripts the Monastery of St. Gall was able to acquire in 1768.",

The poem comprises 21 rhyming stanzas of four lines each, the first of which has neumes on a staff of four lines. This form of notation argues against the manuscript’s originating in St. Gall.",

The latter contain liturgical directives for the worship service as well as rules for daily life in and for the organization of the monastic community of Kastl in the Upper Palatinate (Bavaria). Later these <i>Consuetudines</i> circulated widely and influenced monastic life in many other monasteries in Southern Germany, including in St. Gall. Cod. Sang. 928 is the only manuscript to preserve the original prologue about these reforms by Abbot Otto Nortweiner of Kastl (1378−1399). The manuscript’s original limp vellum binding was restored in the 19th or early 20th century with severe alterations to the original substance of the codex.",

The text is a mixture of a ‘Zeitroman’ (a novel giving a critical analysis of an age) and a debate about the value of women or the lack thereof. An external narrative frame presents a discussion between a young narrator beholden to the courtly ideal and his more experienced master, who clings to a traditional view of women, about the value, significance and conduct of women. Unfortunately from <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0958/196\">p. 196</a> on, essential parts of the text have been lost due to missing pages. This copy, written in East Swabian dialect by scribe A. S. (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0958/219\">p. 219</a>), is dated 1521.",

These include an <i>Ars moriendi</i>, the <i>Cordiale de quattuor novissimis</i> by Gerard van Vliederhoven, the so-called <i>Hieronymus-Briefe</i>(Letters of Jerome) translated by John of Neumark (ca. 1315-1356), the <i>Spiegelbuch</i>, a dialogical text in rhymed verses on living life properly, the trials of worldly life and everyday tribulations, with about twenty colored pen sketches, and a version of the legend of the Three Kings by John of Hildesheim (1310/1320-1375). The manuscript also contains some additional pen sketches: a unicorn (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0985/87\">87</a>), images representing two Apostles (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0985/107\">107</a>; Paul and John?), a man and a woman in secular dress, and a stag and a wild boar (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0985/513\">513</a>).

At the beginning there is the life of Archbishop Johannes of Alexandria (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/5\">5</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/83\">83</a>), written by Anastasius Bibliothecarius. It is followed by the edifying treatise <i>Die vierundzwanzig Alten oder der goldene Thron der minnenden Seele</i> by Otto of Passau (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/87\">87</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/544\">544</a>) and the History of the Three Kings (<i>Historia trium regum</i>) by John of Hildesheim (pp. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/546\">546</a>−<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/602\">602</a>). The treatise by Otto of Passau is illustrated with 25 colored pen and ink drawings, outlined in red and extending the width of the column. The History of the Three Kings begins with a full-page miniature (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/546\">546</a>), which shows the three Magi visiting the infant Jesus. The scribe and the illustrators of this manuscript, which possibly originated in the circle of the community of lay brothers of St. Gall, are unknown; stylistic characteristics suggest the Konstanz book illumination of Rudolf Stahel. The manuscript is dated to the year 1454 in three places (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/93\">93</a> as an inscription in a picture; p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/544\">544</a>; p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0987/602\">602</a>). In the 15th century the manuscript was the property of the community of lay brothers of the Monastery of St. Gall (who did not know Latin); in 1618 the manuscript was still in the library of the community of lay brothers. At least since 1755 it has been attested in the main library of St. Gall Abbey.",

It was commissioned in 1342 by the priest Giacomo <i>de Parazo</i> for a church dedicated to St. Fermo not further identified. This manuscript probably reached Tesserete (Canton of Ticino), an area where the Ambrosian Rite was used, in the 15th/16th century; here it was taken apart and rebound, at which time was added a copy of a testament of dubious authenticity written in 1078 by Contessa from the city of Milan for the benefit of the church of S. Stefano in Tesserete. In the 17th century, the manuscript was the property of the Verdoni family of notaries; since the 20th century, it has been held by the parish of Tesserete. On the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/teap/0001/3/0/Sequence-2222\">initial page</a>, St. Ambrose, the patron saint of the diocese of Milan, is represented in an illuminated initial.",

The top-level organizational elements in the book's decorative program are seven pages decorated with miniatures; multi-line colorful initials mark the secondary textual divisions. The extremely squared illustrations on the decorated pages include scenes with figures enclosed on three sides by staffs entwined by tendrils with decorative gold, red and blue thorny leaves which completely fill the broad parchment margin. Four lines of text, introduced by a large colorful initial, are inserted between the illustration and the lower decorative staff. The beginning of each of the various offices is marked with such an ornamental page. This book of hours is not only the oldest item in the Carl Meyer collection in the Cantonal Library of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, it is one of its best and most valuable items. It is not know who originally commissioned the manuscript.",

It differs, however, in its richer, yet qualitatively narrower range of illustrations: each of the Gospel selections is accompanied by a portrait of its author, and the Marian Office by a complete cycle illustrating the childhood of Jesus. The artist's indirect reception of the originals by the well known Paris illuminator, via a series of intermediate steps, displays numerous misunderstandings or intentional revisions. To the modern eye, accustomed to modern aesthetic norms, the shallow fields, bold juxtaposition of colors, and extremely foreshortened perspective used in these illustrations come across as expressive and inventive. The commissioner of the work is unknown.",

It was written by private initiative between 1510 and 1535 and took as its model primarily the Official Bernese Chronicle - <i>Amtliche Berner Chronik</i> - by Diebold Schilling and the Chronicle - <i>Kronica</i> - by Petermann Etterlin. This volume, the first of the three volumes of the chronicle, covers the history from the legendary origin of Zurich and Lucerne up to Antipope John XXIII’s flight from Constance (1415). Although space was left for illustrations, they were not realized (except those of <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/lsb/Ms0062/12v\">12v</a>). Today the three volumes are held in different libraries: the first volume is in the Leopold-Sophien-Bibliothek in Überlingen, the second in the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/stab/0002\">City Archives in Bremgarten</a>, and the third in the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/kba/Ms-ZF-0018\">Cantonal Library of Aargau</a>.",

The Master of the Mazarine contributed to the ornamentation, as did pseudo-Jacquemart, who belongs to an older generation of artists and whose contribution can be recognized in the famous Books of Hours of the Duke of Berry. The image of <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0100/115r\">David</a> was painted on an inserted double leaf; it can be attributed to a follower of the artist who illuminated the Breviary of John the Fearless.",

Two miniatures as well as the decoration of the calendar and of the Office of the Dead are the work of an artist from the circle of the Maître François, a close collaborator of the Master of Jacques of Besançon, who honors Notre-Dame in a veduta of the city of Paris (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0101/93r\">f. 93r</a>). The luminous colors and the monumental forms of the other miniatures attest to the influence of Jean Bourdichon of Tours. This artist can probably be considered responsible for the Master of the Chronique Scandaleuse, who, during the creation of this manuscript, was still working under the guidance of Jean Bourdichon.",

The miniatures are framed by borders decorated with plants that were executed with great botanical precision. This examplar from the late period of the French Book of hours, preserved in its entirety, was illuminated by an important master from this late phase of French book illumination. He was influenced by the Master of Claude de France und was recently identified as the Master of the Lallemant-Boethius. In the small pictures on the borders, he tries to compete with Jean Bourdichon, who introduced realistic flower borders in the marginal decoration of Anne of Brittany’s Grandes Heures and in other major works. The Master of the Lallemant-Boethius is also guided by Flemish book illumination of his time.

The manuscript was illuminated and dated in 1524 by a Master of Bénigne Serre, who was known by the name of his client, a highly-ranked official of the King of Burgundy. The artist was a hitherto unknown illuminator from the circle of the “1520s The Hours Workshop,” which framed the miniatures with Renaissance architecture or added naturalistic flowers and animals to borders. This manuscript contains a number of unusual images, e.g., for the Lauds of the Office of the Virgin, the meeting of Joachim and Anna at the city gate of Jerusalem replaces the usual image of the Visitation. In the 18th century, the manuscript was owned by the family Bretagne of Dijon, whose family members wrote a „Livre de raison“ on several appended pages.",

Its border decoration remained incomplete, and all the large images follow not the usual canon of images for books of hours, but instead depict unconventional motifs. What strikes the eye in both manuscripts is the motif of the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/doubleview/utp/0110/24v/\">family tree of Adam</a>, which creates an optical link between the volumes and which is not found in other of the book decorator’s manuscripts. The almost identical mass of foliage also suggests that the two volumes could belong together, produced for the king at a certain time interval from one another.

            "Summary (English)" : "This book of hours was a present from the Parisian publisher Anthoine Vérard to the French King Charles VIII (1470-1498). The monarch was one of the most important figures for the French book trade from 1480 on. His collecting is inextricably linked with the luxurious printed materials of the bookseller and publisher Anthoine Vérard. Especially remarkable are the borders: the margins of all pages are decorated with a pictorial narrative of eight consecutive images showing events from the Old and New Testament. Also noteworthy is the didactic value of this book of hours, since each pair of images has a commentary of several explanatory verses in Middle French. Stylistically this book is closely related to <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/utp/0110\">Cod. 110</a>, which was probably also created for the king and was by the same artist.",

            "Summary (English)" : "Sephardic Bible in Hebrew, produced in the first half of the 14th century in Spain, probably in Castile. The manuscript opens and closes with Masoretic lists (ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/IIr/0/Sequence-2186\">IIr</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/IXv/0/Sequence-2186\">IXv</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_463v/0/Sequence-2186\">463v</a> to <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_466v/0/Sequence-2186\">466v</a>), which, framed by illuminated borders, form “carpet pages”. The biblical text, copied into one or two columns, is accompanied by the Small and Large <i>Masora</i> (rules from the rabbinic tradition regarding the reading and vocalization of the sacred texts), which were written in tiny letters in the margins and in the gutters. These micrographic elements are sometimes enlivened in the lower margins of the pages (about 70 occurrences) or on all four sides of the pages (e.g., ff. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_42r/0/Sequence-2186\">42r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_43r/0/Sequence-2186\">43r</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_461v/0/Sequence-2186\">461v</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_463r/0/Sequence-2186\">463r</a>), where they form magnificent geometrical figures and interlace. The first biblical books are introduced by titles that are executed in browned gold on background fields of pink and blue with white scrollwork (f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_1v/0/Sequence-2186\">1v</a>/Gn, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_33v/0/Sequence-2186\">33v</a>/Ex, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_59v/0/Sequence-2186\">59v</a>/Nb, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_77v/0/Sequence-2186\">77v</a>/Dt, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_102v/0/Sequence-2186\">102v</a>/Js, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_125v/0/Sequence-2186\">125v</a>/Jg). According to a note of ownership (f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_467v/0/Sequence-2186\">467v</a>) dated 1367 (?), this Hebrew Bible was probably owned by David ha-Cohen Coutinho, member of a family of Portuguese marranos. In the 15th century, it was the property of Moses Abulafia, until his widow sold it, as shown by the sales contract, dated and signed in 1526 in Thessaloniki and placed in the beginning of the book (f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/Ir/0/Sequence-2186\">Ir</a>). In the 16th century, the Bible was owned by the Talmudist and Rabbi Abraham di Boton of Thessaloniki (f. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/utp/0006/2_467v/0/Sequence-2186\">467v</a>). Thereafter its presence is attested in the Zaradel Synagogue of Alexandria in the 19th century (R. Gottheil, „Some Hebrew Manuscripts in Cairo“ in: Jewish Quarterly Review 17, 1905, p. 648). After the Bible entered the fine arts market, it has been in a private collection since 1996.",

Its significance is not well documented; perhaps originally it served as a basis for financing the communities’ buying their freedom from the Bishop of Chur in 1537, later perhaps it served as a key for distributing the communities’ income from, among other things, the Valtellina districts, from pensions, from tariffs on goods and tolls on roads, etc.  Currently this is the oldest known manuscript from Bergün; it is the property of Werner Dübendorfer of Eglisau. The book containing its continuation, probably up to 1799, has been lost.",

The manuscript contains the entire winter portion of the Temporale, of the Sanctorale and of the Commune Sanctorum according to the liturgy of the Diocese of Lausanne. This volume is the duplicate of <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/one/psle/0001a\">volume I</a>‬, today held in the Catholic parish Saint-Laurent in Estavayer-le-Lac. Originally the volume was decorated with eight initials, of which only two remain (p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mhv/1346/71\">71</a> and p. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mhv/1346/429\">429</a>); they are attributed to the illuminator and copyist Konrad Blochinger, who also added corrections and annotations of the text to the other volumes of this group. After the introduction of the Reformation in the year 1528 and the subsequent secularization of the chapter, the entire group of antiphonaries was sold: four were sold to the city of Estavayer-le-Lac and were used there for the liturgy of the Collegiate Church of St. Lorenz; the other two — including this manuscript — reached Vevey under circumstances that remain unexplained.

            "Summary (English)" : "This volume is part of an antiphonary in three volumes that was produced in duplicate for the liturgy of Bern's Collegiate Church of St. Vincent, founded in 1484/85.  It contains the Proprium de sanctis and the Commune Sanctorum of the summer portion (March 25 to November 25) according to the liturgy of the Diocese of Lausanne. This volume is the duplicate of volume II‬, today held in the Catholic parish Saint-Laurent in Estavayer-le-Lac. \r\nThe three miniatures (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mhv/1347/207\">p. 207</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mhv/1347/271\">p. 271</a> and <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/mhv/1347/397/0/Sequence-1926\">p. 397</a>) that still adorn this volume are attributed to an itinerant artist who was active in Switzerland — in Fribourg, Bern, and Sion —, and afterwards in Piedmont and in the Aosta Valley. He is known by the names Master of the Breviary of Jost von Silenen and  Miniaturist of Georges de Challant. After the introduction of the Reformation in the year 1528 and the subsequent secularization of the chapter, the entire group of antiphonaries was sold: four were sold to the city of Estavayer-le-Lac and were used there for the liturgy of the Collegiate Church of St. Lorenz; the other two — including this manuscript — reached Vevey under circumstances that remain unexplained. They are currently held in the historical museum there.",

A member of the society would be designated as chronicler, who had the task of describing, by the end of the year, all events in Wädenswil that, from his point of view, were of importance. Detailed obituaries of individual personages are contained in the chronicle. For most years, it also includes descriptions of the weather, statistics regarding the population and an overview of food prices. In addition to local events, it also touches on cantonal and federal issues (among them the Bocken War, the Ustertag, the Sonderbund War). The chronicle was handwritten until 1886; the handwritten part consists of two volumes in folio-format. Later volumes consist of pasted newspaper clippings (1890 until 1945) and of typed pages, bound by year (1948-1974). The two volumes for the period from 1797 to 1886 are considered one of the most important sources for the history of Wädenswil in the 19th century.",

The content consists of chronologically ordered entries concerning the business transactions of the convent. The manuscript was produced in the course of the reform period, as the convent was converted from private to communal ownership. Thus this convent book served as a record of the transfer of administrative authority of St. Katharina to the convent community itself and made it possible for the sisters to maintain oversight of the goods they had brought with them when they joined the convent. Records concerning building projects, decoration, scriptorium, legal conflicts and donations, entries concerning individual sisters, pastoral staff and employees as well as sporadic entries about the history of the convent were also set down in this manuscript.",

This abridged version of the 613 positive and negative biblical commandments, and a few additional rabbinic ones, has been divided into seven daily sections to be read sequentially and completed once a week. After becoming popular in France, the SeMaK quickly reached Germany, where it was recognized as an authoritative halakhic work. This manuscript, B115, is the latest of the three manuscripts in the Braginsky Collection (also B240 and B182), exemplifying the complex diffusion of the SeMaK in Germany. The glosses are the work of Moses of Zurich, who lived in Zurich in the middle of the fourteenth century. Consequently, manuscripts containing Moses' glosses are called the <i>Zürcher.</i> Often comments and glosses in the form of rectangular shaped “windows” were added in the margins or in the text itself, producing aesthetically pleasing and imaginative page layouts. By not identifying the sources of these glosses, scribes frequently created difficulties in determining authorship of the commentaries.",

No trace of an original <i>Hillel Codex</i> has survived; it may have been used for the last time for a Pentateuch edition of Guadalajara, Spain, shortly before 1492. In truth, it is not clear whether the <i>Hillel Codex</i> ever existed, or whether it was a legend known from secondary sources. The manuscript is still bound in an old blind-tooled leather binding with (later?) brass ornamentation and clasps.",

The translation is accompanied by the commentary of Moses ben Isaac da Rieti (1388 - after 1460), Chief Rabbi of Rome and poet. His commentary is based largely on the commentaries of Moses Maimonides (1138 - 1240) and of Galen of Pergamum (second century AD).

One of the most important concepts among the kabbalists of Safed was that of mystical prayer, whilst the central concept in this doctrine was that of <i>kavvanah</i> (mystical intention; plural, <i>kavvanot</i>). The <i>Tefillah le-Moshe</i> (Moses' Prayers) contains <i>kavvanot</i> for weekdays and the Shabbat. The round Hebrew cursive, semi-cursive, and square scripts used in the manuscript are enhanced by a variety of pen-work foliage designs. On the title page the scribe referred to himself as “young and insignificant, worm and not a man, AR”I in the city of Modena.” Ari is the Hebrew word for “lion”, but should be understood here as an abbreviation of the copyist’s name, perhaps the well-known writer Juday Aryeh (Leone) Modena (1571-1648).",

The <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0173/2r\">second folio</a> shows the archangel Raphael with the young Tobias, who is carrying home a fish to cure his father’s blindness. The archangel Raphael as guardian angel of children is a motif that usually occurs only in Christian art. Aryeh ben Judah Leib might have used an unknown Catholic model in order to better illustrate the protective function of circumcision for Jewish boys. \nIn his writing, Aryeh ben Judah was guided by Amsterdam letters and thus initiated the fashion of <i>be-otijjot Amsterdam</i> (\"with Amsterdam letters\"), producing manuscripts with Amsterdam (print) fonts.",

This day, when work originally was not allowed, later, through the compilation of the Talmud, developed into a minor festival. The mystics of Safed in Upper Galilee turned <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> into a fast day and developed a liturgy based on penitential prayers for <i>Yom Kippur</i> (\"Day of Atonement\"). This gave rise to the name <i>Yom Kippur Katan</i> (\"Minor Day of Atonement\"). The new custom spread to Italy and finally on to Northern Europe.\nSimilar collections of prayers were particularly popular in the 18th century. In contrast to many others, this exemplar is decorated with an illustrated <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0235/1r\">title page</a>. If Judah Leib ben Meir of Glogau had not identified himself as scribe on this <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0235/1r\">title page</a>, it would probably be assumed to be the work of Aaron Wolf Herlingen of Gewitsch, since the style and the script correspond to his.

This autograph manuscript contains commentaries on the prayer book, on the <i>Birkat Hamason</i> (\"Grace after Meals\"), on the Haggadah and on the <i>Pirkei Avot</i>  (\"Sayings of the Fathers\") as well as prayer-related customs and autobiographical remarks. The comments on <i>Minhagim</i> (\"customs\") were incorporated into the printed edition of the Wormser Minhagbuch, but large parts of this manuscript remain unpublished and serve as an important source for the religious history of one of the most significant Jewish communities in Europe. This manuscript belonged to, among others, Rabbi Michael Scheyer; later it was part of the private library of Salman Schocken in Jerusalem.",

            "Summary (English)" : "The Spanish kabbalist Abraham Abulafia (1240- after 1291) advocated a concept of Kabbalah that had little or nothing to do with the well-known schools of thought. He considered Kabbalah neither as a form of gnosis nor as a kind of theosophical theory that concentrates on the <i>Sefirot</i>, the emanation of the Divine Being. Instead he attempted to attain a state of prophetic-mystical ecstasy, based on his conviction that the experience of the prophets was an ecstatic experience and that all true mystics were prophets. This work of his was especially popular and circulated under the titles <i>Hayyei ha-Olam ha-Ba</i> (\"Life of the World to Come\"), <i>Sefer ha-Shem</i> (\"Book of the Divine Name\") or <i>Sefer ha-Iggulim</i> (\"Book of Circles\"); in this manuscript, however, it is called <i>Sefer ha-Shem ha-Meforash</i> (\"Book of the Ineffable name\"). The manuscript presents ten inscriptions in concentric circles in red and black ink, as well as 128 only in black ink. They contain detailed instructions for mystical meditation. While contemplating these circles, one should recite the 72-lettered name of God, which is arrived at by combining the numerical values of the letters in the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, of the Patriarchs, and the nine letters of the words <i>shivtei yisra’el</i> (\"the tribes of Irasel\"). The reader should \"enter\" each of the triple black and red circles at the point where an \"entrance\" is designated by means of a small pen stroke.",

Contentwise the manuscript contains various teachings based on the views of Jacob Moellin (1360-1427). He is regarded as one of the most important spiritual authorities of the Ashkenazic world. The manuscript probably was written in the last third of the 15th century in Northern Italy, since the pen drawings can be placed in the Northern Italian tradition of that period. Several motifs from the manuscript seem to \"grow\" out of an ornament, such as a head with a bumpy nose and heavy eyelids or a long city wall with round towers, and are considered typical for Joel ben Simeon, the most important representative of this Northern Italian tradition of illustration.",

It contains daily prayers and <i>piyyutim</i> for holidays and special occasions. In addition, it contains the entire text of the Haggadah, which at this time already tended to be copied out separately. The manuscript contains interesting evidence of the influence of censorship. During the Middle Ages, the prayer <i>Alenu le-shabbeah</i> was believed to contain an insult to Christianity. As in many other cases, here, too, the controversial passage was omitted by the copyist (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0253/19r\">f. 19r</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0253/19v\">v</a>). In the 16th century, the entire manuscript was inspected by Dominico Irosolimitano in Mantua, one of the most active censors of Jewish writings in Italy. However, he did not expurgate a single passage, but merely signed the last page of the manuscript (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0253/112v\">f. 112v</a>), thus confirming his inspection.",

The <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> (abbreviated the SeMaG) became a major and accepted source of halakhic rulings. It was frequently quoted and abridged; many commentaries were composed on it. The manuscript was copied by Hayyim ben Meir ha-Levi in 1288, possibly in Sierre, (Switzerland). This hypothesis is based on the fact that in the Biblothèque national in Paris there is another manuscript (ms. hébr.370) of the same work, by the same scribe, which is assumed to have been copied in Sierre a few years later than the Braginsky manuscript. More than two centuries after the writing of the manuscript, in 1528, Joseph ben Kalonymos acquired it in Posen (Poland) and completed the few leaves that were missing by that time.",

The collection of documents constitute a more or less chronological account of the events and were probably a part of a file that belonged to a Venetian Inquisitor. Reproduced here is a summary (regesta) of six papal briefs from 1518-1537, in which Popes Leo X, Clement VII, and Paul III grant Daniel Bomberg licenses to print Hebrew books in Venice. Other documents include: orders to converted former Jews to inspect Hebrew texts for heretical content, copies of the relevant papal decrees, and reports on the events in Rome and Venice.",

About 40 manuscripts signed by him are extant today. This manuscript is ornamented with 60 painted illustrations and three word panels with decorated initials. The <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0284/1r\">title page</a> depicts Moses and Aaron on either side of the title. The area below the title shows the Israelites wandering through the desert and manna falling from heaven, alongside Moses, Aaron and their sister Miriam. Such a very unusual depiction of Miriam suggests that this Haggadah was produced for a woman of that name. At the end of the text there are two songs - one in Hebrew, the other in Aramaic - <i>Echad mi-yodea</i>  and <i>Had Gadya</i>, with their respective Yiddish translations.",

The characteristics of Joseph ben David’s illustrations, whose work is well-known, are rendered here in an exemplary manner. The color palette is dominated by subtle gradations of color and  shades of pastel. Frequently recurring motifs in his Haggadot, based on older models, are the illustrations of the Paschal lamb, the matzah and the bitter herbs. Eating these is part of the feast of Passover, during which it is tradition to read the Haggadah together.",

XXXII) shows that both <i>Birkat ha-mason</i> manuscripts were created by the same artist, namely Samuel ben Zewi Hirsch Drenitz, who was active in Nikolsburg.",

By using three different types of writing, he clearly distinguishes three types of texts: the Hebrew text of the Haggadah, the classical Hebrew commentary by Simeon ben Zemach Duran (1361-1444), and a German translation in Hebrew letters by  Wolf Heidenheim (1757-1832). The iconographic program of the <i>Elieser Sussmann Meseritsch Haggadah </i> is very unusual. The <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0350/1r\">title page</a> presents an architectural design of triumphal arches, where various ornamental motifs in classicist style are creatively joined together.

The next two illustrations – the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0350/12r\">12r</a>) and King David with the harp (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0350/15v\">15v</a>) – are rather conventional. The <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0350/23v\">last scene</a> with the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem as usual accompanies the text of the <i>Adir hu</i> (“Almighty God, rebuild your Temple soon!”).",

According to tradition, he spent three decades working on his commentary, writing his own thoughts and remarks in the margins next to and around the text of his printed edition of the complete Mishnah. His notes became so crowded that he himself had difficulty deciphering them, whereupon a patron enabled him to rewrite his collection of thoughts into a coherent work; the result is this Mishnah commentary. The Mishnah consists of six orders; this text is a commentary on the first part, the <i>Zera’im</i> (\"Seeds\"), pertaining to blessings, prayers and laws related to agriculture. The Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York holds a corresponding commentary on the sixth order of the Mishnah, the <i>Tohorot</i> (\"Purities\") (MS Rab33). It is dated 1611, so we can assume that our manuscript was written earlier.",

The ceremony, depicted on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0052/10r\">f. 10r</a>, takes place in a synagogue. The prophet Elijah, who will come in order to announce the advent of the Messiah, is considered to be present at the ceremony. An illustration on <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0052/18r\">f. 18r</a> depicts the blessing over wine. The decoration is the work of the illustrator Uri Fayvesh ben Isaac  Segal, who was a prominent representative of the so-called Hamburg-Altona school for the production of 18th-century illuminated manuscripts, and who, according to current research, produced at least five more manuscripts in addition to this one. The <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0052/2r\">title page</a> bears the name of the owner, Joseph ben Samuel, as well as a not yet identified coat of arms with the Order of the Elephant, the highest order of the Royal House of Denmark.",

In the kabbalistic school of Safed (Upper \r\nGalilee), the mystical aspect of prayer, as “the vehicle of the soul's \r\nmystical ascent to God,” is of great importance. The authorship of this \r\nprayer books is generally attributed to Isaac ben Solomon Luria \r\n(1534–1572). The manuscript begins with an unfinished <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/b-0057/1r\">title page</a>\r\n that contains a decorative floral border in red, yellow and green, but \r\nwithout any text. In the ornamental colorful border there is the \r\ninscription “Samuel ha-Kohen, cantor in Broda,” who is either the \r\ncopyist or perhaps the person for whom the book was written. The \r\nmanuscript was a part of the collection of Naphtali Herz van Biema \r\n(1836-1901), an Amsterdam collector, whose books were auctioned in 1904.\r\n Many of these books had previously belonged to his wife's family of \r\nprominent orthodox philanthropists and bibliophiles known as the \r\nAmsterdam Lehren family.",

Additional poems are by a variety of poets, some by writers of the Hebrew Golden Age in medieval Spain, others by local authors, such as Elieser de Mordo. This manuscript is of great significance due to a cycle of sixty full-page illustrations from the Book of Genesis, executed in gouache. The illustrations are accompanied by Hebrew inscriptions, usually biblical verses identifying the scenes. They are the work of an artist, probably trained in Venice, who added his monogram in different variants (MC or M.C. MF.) to almost all of the illustrations. The left to right sequence of the pages suggests that a Christian artist must have first created the illustrations, and that the Hebrew texts were added afterwards. This manuscript from the first half of the 18th century, created on the island of Corfu, may have been a bridal gift from a member of the de Mordo family, a family which played an important role on the island at a time when the Venetian rule had to be defended against Ottoman attacks.",

The upper section depicts a pair of lions crouched back-to-back, overlaid with circles containing the abbreviated Ten Commandments. The composition is reminiscent of the top of Torah arks, and indeed it is topped with a crown, intended as a Torah Crown. The crouching lions are flanked by vases of flowers. In the side borders, beneath theatrical drapery and trumpets suspended from ribbons, fanciful column bases are surmounted by urns. Several elements in the marriage contract are characteristic of Gibraltar <i>ketubot</i>. The initial word of the wedding day, Wednesday, as was common, is enlarged and ornamented. Also typical of Gibraltar is the ornamental Latin monogram at bottom center. Comprising the letters SJB, it refers to the bridal couple’s first (Solomon, Judith) and last (Benoleil) initials.",

The upper story employs a dynamic rhythm of decorative architectural elements. The entire structure resembles a typical Sephardic Torah ark (<i>ehal</i>) from the synagogues in Gibraltar.

The text of this <i>ketubah</i> is centered under the arch supported by a pair of ornamental columns. While arches were commonly used as framing devices in <i>ketubah</i> decorations since the earliest known <i>ketubot</i> from the Cairo Genizah, the gold letters inscribed here against the blue spandrels provide an additional meaning. The six square Hebrew letters, an acronym for Psalms 118:20: “This is the gate of the Lord, through which the righteous may enter”, signify that the bridal couple is symbolically passing through the heavenly gate into a sanctified stage in their life. A depiction of the sacrifice of Isaac, an allusion to the bridegroom whose second name is Isaac, is located in a cartouche at the top center. This scene, a symbol of faithfulness and messianic promise that appears on many italian <i>ketubot</i>, has been the most popular biblical story in Jewish art over the ages. The female figure beneath has not been identified so far.",

A large cartouche rests on the arch supported by the columns. In it is a pastoral landscape in which stand a man wearing a long robe and a bare-breasted woman, joined around their neck by a long chain of pearls with a heart-shaped pendant. Enhancing the allusion of matrimonial harmony are family emblems of the bridal couple that appear next to each other in a cartouche above the central allegorical image. The emblem at the right, above the central allegorical image, depicting a rampant lion climbing a palm tree, is that of the groom's family, Caiatte, whereas the emblem at the left, portraying a rampant lion touching a white column, belongs to the family of the bride, De Castro. Finally, the influence of Italian culture is demonstrated in the cartouche at the bottom, with the depiction of Cupid lying next to his bow and quiver.",

The arches are surmounted by a balustrade that supports flowering urns, blank medallions, floral scrollwork, and a variety of birds including a crowned double-headed eagle and a peacock. Scenes from the Esther narrative are positioned beneath each of the nineteen columns of text. The engraved border of this scroll was designed by the Italian scholar, artist, and publisher Francesco Griselini (1717-1787), whose engraved border designs were popular in Italy in the eighteenth century. In these illustrations, Griselini has devoted particular attention to architectural settings and spatial perspective. The artist’s printed signature is found in the lower left corner of each membrane. The <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/bc/s-0013/recto_010\">last scene</a>, placed under the final arch, is rarely found on illustrated Ester scrolls. It depicts the Messiah riding on a donkey heralding the return of the exiled Jewish people back to Jerusalem. The text of this scroll was penned by the scribe-artist Aryeh Leib ben Daniel. In his inscription, which follows the concluding benedictions, he informs the reader that he wrote this scroll in Venice in the winter of 1746.",

This Braginsky Collection <i>megillah</i> is one of three similar German scrolls containing distinctive images of Haman hanging.

            "Summary (English)" : "This scroll contains one of the most finely executed series of illustrations to be found in decorated <i>megillot</i> (sing. <i>megillah</i>). The highly accomplished artist Wolf Leib Katz Poppers has modeled detailed figures, scenes, and animals with delicate parallel and cross-hatched pen strokes, creating an effect that is strikingly similar to the copperplate engravings of contemporary books. Positioned between a foliate border with animals at the top and a similar one with birds at the bottom, text columns are interspersed with eight elegant full-length characters from the Esther story. Below each of these figures is a small vignette that chronicles the Purim story. It is unusual that the skillfully drawn figures that embellish this scroll are dressed in Ottoman-court clothing. The choice of this type of dress is intriguing, and perhaps the most cogent reason for this combination is that the scroll was produced for a member of a small, affluent community of Turkish Jews who, after 1718, were permitted to live and trade freely in Vienna, while still remaining subjects of the Sultan of Turkey.",

The reader is shown surrounded by men wearing fezes and children holding drums used as noisemakers to drawn out the name of Haman. Additionally, a group of five women is portrayed in a separate space above labeled <i>ezrat nashim</i> (woman’s section). The figures in the scroll are depicted in a mixture of contemporary, Western and non-Western clothing, and often are seated in interiors that portray a similar blend of furnishings. Some of the women, including Esther at times, are shown with a Hindu <i>bindi</i> sign on their foreheads. This scroll comes from the collection of the eminent Sassoon family of Baghdadi Jewish descent. It was most likely created for their personal use. The merging of Jewish scribal traditions and Indian artistic design reflects the Sassoon family’s deep involvement in the cultural life of India.",

The cylindrical case of this scroll is ornamented with applied filigree. Emerging from a vase at the center is a large naturalistic flowering wine with scrolling stems and blossoms that extend across the case’s decorated surface. Large blossoms support or frame the objects associated with the Holy Temple of Jerusalem. Although these motifs are frequently found on a variety of Italian Jewish ritual metalwork, they do not relate specifically to the Esther story. In addition, the Ten Tablets of the Law are placed on the largest central floral motif, a wreath composed of small flower forms that may suggest sunflowers. There are two similar Esther scroll cases of this type undoubtedly created by the same maker. They have been localized to seventeenth-century Rome or Venice. This undecorated scroll is probably from the 18th century.",

            "Summary (English)" : "The Zurich armorial on parchment is one of the most important and most unusual documents of medieval heraldry. Today it consists of four parts of various lengths, which can be combined into one four-meter-long roll. Painted on both sides of the parchment, it depicts 559 coats of arms, each shield decorated with a crest, of high and lower nobility from Northern Switzerland, Southern Germany and Western Austria. Names are given next to each shield. In addition there are 28 flags of German bishoprics and monasteries. The order of these four remaining parts, which consist of thirteen parchment leaves that were sewn together, is as follows: Part I (36.5 cm) contains the coats of arms of the bishoprics and monasteries on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/1v\">verso side</a> (Merz-Hegi numbering: I-XXVIII; the numbering in the original is from the 16th/17th century) and 22 noble coats of arms on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/1r\">recto side</a> (1-22). Parts 2 and 3 (255.5 cm) were still sewn together in 1930. Part 2, consisting of four parchment leaves, contains the coats of arms 23-104 and 108-114  on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/2r\">recto side</a> and the coats of arms 214-220, 224-308 on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/2v\">verso side</a>. Part 3, consisting of three parchment leaves sewn together, contains the coats of arms 105-107, 115-162 on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/3r\">recto side</a> and the coats of arms 163-213, 221-223 on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/3v\">verso side</a>. Part 4 (109 cm), consisting of five parchment leaves sewn together, contains the coats of arms 309-378 on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/4r\">recto side</a> and the coats of arms 379-450 on the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/AG002760/4v\">verso side</a>. The armorial is incomplete. The missing fourth part should have contained another 109 coats of arms, which are known from a late 18th century copy of the roll. The armorial was probably created in Zurich or in the area of Lake Constance. It can be dated to the period between 1330 and 1345. The style of the workmanship is reminiscent of the famous Codex Manesse, a collection of poems in German with 137 miniatures, also created in Zurich, but somewhat older. The Zurich armorial was owned by Zürich historian and naturalist Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (1672–1733); later it became part of the collection of the Antiquarian Society of Zurich and then of the Swiss National Museum.",

The prototype of this dynastic cycle of pictures is the <i>Ehrenspiegel des Hauses Österreich</i>, which was commissioned between 1555 and 1559 by Johann Jakob Fugger in Augsburg.

After the doge, the procurators held the highest office in the Serenissima; upon their election, they had capitularies drawn up, usually illuminated, containing their oath and the list of their “commissione,” i.e., of the specific tasks to which they committed themselves by their oath. This fragment follows 21 commissions of Venetian procurators from the 15th century; it is distinguished from the others by its illumination, which is attributed to a high-level Venetian master trained in the circle of Leonardo Bellini, and also by the rare depiction of the patron saint of not only the procurator, but also his wife.",

            "Summary (English)" : "This gradual is from the Dominican Convent St. Katharinenthal and represents one of the most important artworks of the Gothic period in Switzerland. Created around 1312 in the convent itself, it was probably illuminated in the area around Lake Constance. It contains more than 80 pen-flourish initials, more than 60 historiated initials and 5 I-initials, which consist of several historiated medallions. Several pieces of the last two I-initials, whose medallions were cut out and sold separately, are known today; they are dispersed among various museums and libraries. In addition to the initials, in the floral friezes there are represented numerous kneeling and praying Dominican nuns as well as other secular donors (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/LM026117/3v\">3v</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/LM026117/18v\">18v</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/LM026117/90r\">90r</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/LM026117/159v\">159v</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/LM026117/161r\">161r</a> etc.).     Until the 19th century, the gradual was in use in the convent; around 1820 it was ceded to an   antiquarian book dealer in Konstanz, Franz Joseph Aloys Castell (1796-1844). After 1860 it was owned by the English collectors Sir William Amherst of Hackney and Sir Charles Dyson Perrins (1864-1958). Upon the death of the latter, his library was offered for sale through Sotheby's, and the manuscript was purchased by the Swiss Confederation with the support of the Gottfried Keller-Foundation and the Canton of Thurgau.",

On the <a href=\"https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/bindingE/0/Sequence-1049\">inside of the cover</a> are found the large coats of arms of Burkhart von Hallwil and his two wives Judith von Anwil and Margaretha von Löwenberg. <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/4\">Pp. 4</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/10\">10</a> contain a late version of the poem <i>Ring von Hallwil</i>, a saga about the endangerment and saving of the inheritance of the Hallwils. On pp. 11-17 there follow texts about family history and then a second, older version of the poem <i>Ring von Hallwil</i> (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/19\">pp. 19</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/21\">21</a>). After a number of empty pages, there are six empty crests (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/48\">pp. 48</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/50\">50</a>), meant for the three brothers Thüring I von Hallwil († 1386) und Katharina von Wolfurt, Walter V († after 1370) and Herzlaude von Tengen, “Hemann” (Johannes IV, † 1386) and Anna vom Hus. On <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/51\">p. 51</a> there is a view of the ancestral home of the Hallwil family. It is followed by pictures of Caspar (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/54\">p. 54</a>) and Burkhart von Hallwil (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/55\">p. 55</a>), scenes from tournaments (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/56\">pp. 56</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/59\">59</a>), and images relating to the <i>Ring von Hallwil</i> (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/60\">pp. 60</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/66\">66</a>). At the end of the manuscript, there are more coats of arms of the Lords of Hallwil and their wives (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/68\">pp. 68</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/96\">96</a>), the last ones only sketched out but not completed (<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/97\">pp. 97</a>-<a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/snm/SH000228/118\">118</a>). The manuscript was donated to the Swiss National Museum in 1907 by Count Walther von Hallwil, the last occupant of the castle, and his wife Wilhelmine.

            "Summary (English)" : "The Rheinau Psalter, Ms. Rh. 167, is among the preeminent treasures of the Zurich Central Library. Its miniatures are a product of the highest level of artistry of the High Gothic painting of this period around 1260, which is also true for the sophisticated color and painting techniques that were used. In contrast, the script, while of quite good quality, cannot be counted among the highest examples of the art of writing. The commissioner of the manuscript must be sought in the area of Lake Constance, probably in the city of Constance, which was very important in the politics and church politics at the time of the interregnum. In 1817, Father Blasius Hauntinger purchased the manuscript from Melchior Kirchhofer in Schaffhausen for the Benedictine Rheinau Abbey; in 1863, the manuscript, along with the Rheinau Abbey Library, became part of the Cantonal Library (today Central Library) in Zurich.",

The manuscript also contains numerous other alchemical treatises, for ex. Albertus Magnus on <i>Secreta Hermetis philosophi</i>, Johannes de Garlandia (John of Garland), excerpts from Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan), the <i>Thesaurus philosophiae</i> and the <i>Visio Arislei</i>. Nine other Aurora-manuscripts are currently known to exist: Berlin <i>Die uffgehnde Morgenrödte</i>, Bologna, Glasgow, Leiden, Vienna, Paris, Prague and Venice. The Berlin manuscript, dating from the early sixteenth century and containing the illustrations as well as the texts in German translation, is closely related to the Zürich Codex.",

Codices of Fraternisation contain a list of the members of the monastery's confraternities who were required to include the other living or deceased members of the confraternity into their daily prayers. The zone of influence was large, reaching from Reichenau in the South to Monteverde and Conques, from Mondsee in the East to Fulda and St. Trond in the North as well as to Jumièges in the West. Over 38.000 names are documented. The earliest entries have been continuously amended and updated for several centuries. At the end of the volume, following the Codex of Fraternisation, there are 15 leaves of parchment from the 10th-12th centuries containing lists of friars, additional names and transcriptions of charters. At the beginning of the volume there are straps glued on paper containing agreements of fraternisation and obituaries from the 14-16th centuries.",

The pictures presented here of military technology were perhaps originally part of a medieval house book. A typical collector’s item, this illuminated manuscript underscores the collection character of the Rheinau conventual library, whose librarians and abbots were expressly on the lookout for rare books.",
